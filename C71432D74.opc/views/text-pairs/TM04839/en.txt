Wrathful Guru Mantra Visualization
In an instant of perfect recollection,
I arise as the Wrathful Guru, blue-black in colour,
I brandish a vajra in my right hand and hold a skull-cup filled with blood in my left.
I stand on the back of a dark brown wild boar,
From whose mouth the fiery sparks of wrathful mantras blaze forth.
I emanate inconceivable numbers of wild boar
Who devour all illness and spirit harm.
The blazing fire of their roaring wrathful mantras shoots like sparks,
Incinerating all illness and demons.
