The Swift Infusion of Blessings In Praise of Mañjughoṣa
Dhīḥ. Primordial buddha Mañjuśrīghoṣa, pervasive as the sky,
Your singular eye of pristine wisdom is entirely without flaws,
And you gleam with the light of the pure signs and marks—
To the king of supreme body, I offer homage and praise.
With your voice of Brahma and selfless leonine roar,
You strike fear into the wild beasts of the tīrthikas.
Inexpressible, you are the basis of all expression—
To the ‘Gentle Melody’ of supreme speech, I offer homage and praise.
Master of the limits of the authentic and reality as such,
The ultimate dharmakāya of naturally arisen wisdom,
Profound peace beyond complexity, luminous and unconditioned—
To Mañjuvajra of supreme mind, I offer homage and praise.
Great and mighty lord of all the thus-gone buddhas,
Vast store of inexhaustible, ocean-like qualities,
Forefather to all the victorious ones of the three times—
To you, possessor of supreme qualities, I offer homage and praise.
Just like a wish-granting gem or a wish-fulfilling tree,
To the farthest reaches of space, as long as beings remain,
Your enlightened activity continues without interruption—
To you whose activity is supreme, I offer homage and praise.
Through praising you, wisdom-being Mañjuśrī, in this way,
May you remain forever gladly upon the lotus of my heart,
Banish ignorance’s darkness, open the channels to wisdom,
And grant the eight treasures of eloquence and supreme intellect. 1
Oṃ arapacana dhīḥ.
