Prayer Written for Lama Chödrak
Manifestation of the Mañjughoṣa Guru’s 1 primordial wisdom,
Sublime friend and protector of the teachings and beings in this degenerate age,
Jamyang Lodrö Gyatso, to you I pray:
Inspire me to realize the natural state!
May I see my own true face, primordially pure dharmakāya awareness,
May the spontaneously present visions of clear light reach their full measure,
May whatever arises be freed in its own place through uncontrived action,
And may I actualize the fruition of the three kāyas present within the ground.
