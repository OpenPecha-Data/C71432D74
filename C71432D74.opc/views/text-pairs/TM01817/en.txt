The Benefits of Creating Sacred Objects
by Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol
The benefits of creating sacred objects are as follows: 
One will be happy in this life and become a Buddha in future.
All who see sacred objects close the door to the lower realms.
Even evildoers will travel to places within the higher realms.
Prostration or circumambulation lead to rebirth as a universal monarch.
Offering butter lamps results in an attractive form and clear intelligence.
Prayer will bring blessings and attainments.
Any connection, through seeing, hearing, holding in mind, or physical contact, will prove significant. 
Through the benefit of creating representations of enlightened body, speech or mind,
May the teachings of the Victorious Ones flourish and all beings attain awakening.[1]
May all lands enjoy good fortune and excellent harvests,
And may great auspiciousness pervade the three worlds. 
This explanation of sacred objects, the All-Encompassing Jewel, was composed by Shabkar. May it be auspicious![2]
