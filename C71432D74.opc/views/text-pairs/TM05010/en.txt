General Prayer for Swift Rebirth
To the unfailing Three Jewels and yidam deities,
I pray with unfeigned devotion of body, speech and mind:
Confer your attainments and blessings, so that the hopes of disciples
Who lack guidance and protection may be fulfilled without impediment.
Venerable guru, whose rūpakāya has now dissolved
Into the dharmadhātu, look with love from the invisible sphere,
And, out of compassion for those to be trained,
Swiftly return, I pray, as a nirmāṇakāya emanation.
May dharmapālas and guardians on whom we rely and to whom we make offerings,
Carry out activity to ensure that wherever this authentic guru’s incarnation is reborn,
All obstacles and adversity may be pacified,
And all circumstances may be favourable as aspirations are fulfilled.
Through the blessings of the Victorious Ones and their heirs throughout the ten directions,
And all the virtue that I and others accumulate throughout the three times,
May the glorious guru’s nirmāṇakāya swiftly return
To become a source of benefit for the teachings and all beings.
