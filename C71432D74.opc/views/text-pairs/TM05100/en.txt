The Vajravidāraṇa Dhāraṇī
In the language of India: Vajravidāraṇa-nāma-dhāraṇī
In the language of Tibet: dorjé nampar jompa shé chawé zung
In the English language: The Incantation known as Vajra Subduer
Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus have I heard at one time.
The Blessed One was abiding in Vajra. 1
Through the power of the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi’s entire body was consecrated as vajra
And Vajrapāṇi entered the vajra-like samādhi.
Then, through the power of the Buddha,
The blessing of all the buddhas,
And the blessing of all the bodhisattvas,
Vajrapāṇi proclaimed the vajra-essence which arose from vajra-wrath:
“It is unbreakable, indestructible, true, solid, stable, unobstructed by all, and invincible by all; 2
It terrifies all beings,
It makes all beings flee,
It severs all vidyā-mantras, 3
It suppresses all vidyā-mantras;
It defeats all saṃsāric actions;
It neutralizes all that others do to you;
It crushes all obstructing forces;
It liberates from all obstructing forces;
It controls all spirits; 4
It enacts the functions of all vidyā-mantras;
It accomplishes what has not been accomplished;
It preserves all that has been accomplished;
It grants all wishes;
It protects, pacifies and enriches all beings;
And it paralyses and stupefies all beings.”
Through the power of the Buddha, Vajrapāṇi then proclaimed this very powerful secret mantra:

Through purifying all negativity,
This mantra removes all suffering.
It is the root of all tantras,
Perfectly adorned with every splendour.
All beings with weakened faculties,
Whose life-force is exhausted or weakened,
All who are in inauspicious circumstances,
Forsaken by the gods,
People who face hostility from close ones,
Oppressed people, such as servants,
Those who live in discord,
Who are harmed by loss of wealth,
Who are in despair or injured,
Frightened or destitute,
Afflicted by harmful planets, constellations or curses,
Who are harmed intolerably by spirits,
Who see evil omens in dreams
Caused by weariness or sorrow—
All are completely cleansed by this mantra and thus become pure.
Listen, therefore, to this sacred sūtra!
All who have a virtuous and pure mind,
And are adorned with fine clothes–
When they listen to this sutra,
The Buddha’s profound domain—
Will, through the splendour of this sūtra,
Be cured of
All diseases,
Even the most intractable ones;
Their lifespan and merit will increase,
And they will be freed from all negativity!
Take a vase made of gold, silver or the like, 5
And fill it with precious substances, jewels, mustard seeds, dūrvā -grass,
Sandalwood, crystals,
Diamonds, flowers,
And water.
Attach a clean cloth to it.
Recite the Vajravidāraṇa mantra
Twenty-one times, or
One hundred and eight,
O King, and therewith always perform ablutions. 6
