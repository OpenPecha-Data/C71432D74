Homage to ever-youthful Mañjuśrī!
Then Vajradhara, ever glorious,
Supreme subduer of the hard to tame,
The hero conquering the triple world,
The vajra lord and master of all secrets, (1)
With eyes wide open like white lotuses,
His face just like a lily in full bloom, 3
While shaking in his hand repeatedly
A vajra of the highest excellence—(2)
Accompanied by countless Vajrapāṇis,
With features such as fierce, turbulent brows,
Subduers of the hard to tame, heroes,
Appearing with heroic, hideous forms, (3)
Brandishing in their hands their mighty vajras,
The tips of which emit intensive light,
Great benefactors to all living beings
Through skill, through insight, and through great compassion, (4)
With pleased and happy attitudes, with joy,
Their bodies those of wrathful deities,
Protectors who assist the buddhas’ deeds,
Their bodies bowing reverentially—(5)
Paid homage to the true awakened one,
Protector, Blessed One, Tathāgata.
And joining his two palms respectfully,
He said before the lord the following: (6)
‘O omnipresent lord, for my well-being,
With due concern for me and for my sake,
That I may reach complete awakening
Upon the basis of Illusion’s Net; 4 (7)
And for the sake of every living being—
Sunk deep into the mud of ignorance,
Their thoughts disturbed by various afflictions—
So that they may obtain the highest fruit, (8)
May you—the most supreme awakened one,
The Blessed One, the world’s guru, and teacher,
Who knows the great samaya’s reality,
Aware of wishes and abilities—(9)
Reveal to us the great name chanting of
The wisdom body of the Blessed One,
The great uṣṇīṣa , master of all speech,
The self-arising wisdom emanation, (10)
The wisdom deity called Mañjuśrī;
These names with meaning both profound and vast;
Of great significance; unmatched; serene;
With goodness at their start, middle, and end; (11)
Proclaimed by buddhas of the aeons past,
And to be taught by buddhas yet to come;
And taught not once but time and time again
By all the buddhas of the present age; (12)
Which were respectfully recited in
Illusion’s Net, the tantra most supreme,
By multitudes of mighty Vajrapāṇis,
The joyous guardians of secret mantras. (13)
Just this I shall uphold with firm resolve,
Until I reach my final liberation,
So that I may become, O great protector,
The bearer of the buddhas’ every secret; (14)
And this I shall reveal to living beings
According to each one’s capacity,
In order that afflictions may be quelled,
So ignorance may fully be dispelled.’ (15)
With this request to the Tathāgata,
The master of all secrets, Vajrapāṇi—
His body bowed, his palms politely joined—
Then stood before the lord devotedly. (16)
And so the Blessed One, lord Śākyamuni,
The best of men, the fully awakened one,
Extending from his mouth his handsome tongue,
A tongue unmatched in both its breadth and length, (17)
Displaying a gentle smile to living beings—
A smile that fills the threefold world with light;
That tames the enemy, the four Māras;
That ends unwanted birth in all three forms 5 —(18)
His voice melodious, like that of Brahmā,
Completely filling all the triple world,
Replied as follows to the lord of secrets,
To Vajrapāṇi, strongest of the strong: (19)
‘That you, abounding in supreme compassion
And aiming to assist all living beings,
Are willing and prepared to hear from me
This evil-quelling, purifying chanting—(20)
The chanting of the names, so filled with meaning,
Of Mañjuśrī’s embodiment of wisdom—
How truly excellent, O Vajradhara;
How excellent of you, O Vajrapāṇi! (21)
And so I shall, O master of all secrets,
Reveal just that to you most splendidly.
With single-minded focus, listen well!’
‘How excellent!’ responded Vajrapāṇi, ‘So truly excellent, O Blessed One.’ (22)
And then the Blessed One, lord Śākyamuni,
Surveyed in full the family great with mantras,
The family of the vidyās and the mantras ,
The family that is threefold by its nature, (23)
The family of and yet beyond the world,
The family great in brightening the world,
The foremost family of mahāmudrā ,
And so the family great with great uṣṇīṣas . (24)
And then, about the lord of speech, 6 he spoke
These verses, which include six kingly mantras, 7
Which manifest from non-duality,
Which bear the quality of non-arising: (25)
a ā i ī u ū e ai
o au aṃ aḥ sthito hṛdi |

buddhānāṃ trya-dhva-vartinām 8 || (26)

For, fit for all, he is the best of men;
Surpassing all to which he is compared,
Supreme most lord of knowing and what’s known, (155)
The foremost master of imparting Dharma,
Who shows the meaning of the fourfold seal, 83
The most revered amongst all living beings
Engaged in going forth on all three paths, (156)
With glory purified by ultimate truth,
Most fortunate within the threefold world,
The celebrated source of all endowments,
Supreme among the glorious, Mañjuśrī. (157)
Homage to you, boon granter, best of vajras;
O summit of existence, homage to you;
Homage to you, whose source is emptiness;
O Buddha’s awakening, homage to you; (158)
O passion of the buddhas, homage to you;
Desire of the buddhas, I pay you homage;
O love of every buddha, homage to you;
The joy of all the buddhas, I pay you homage; (159)
O smile of every buddha, homage to you;
The laugh of all the buddhas, I pay you homage;
O speech of every buddha, homage to you;
The heart of all the buddhas, I pay you homage; (160)
Arisen from non-being, homage to you;
Homage to you, arisen from the buddhas;
Arisen from the sky, homage to you;
Homage to you, born of pristine wisdom; (161)
O net of illusion, homage to you;
Homage to you, the buddhas’ spectacle;
Homage to you, the everything of all;
O body of wisdom, homage to you! (162)

Then Vajradhara, ever glorious,
Most pleased and satisfied, with folded palms,
Prostrated to the Buddha, noble guard,
The Blesssed One, the lord Tathāgata; (163)
And with a host of other Vajrapāṇis—
Of varied forms, the lords of guhyakas,
Sublime protectors, noble wrathful kings—
He then exclaimed this effervescent praise: (164)
Protector, we rejoice! How excellent!
How excellent what you have clearly taught!
Through you our lofty aim has been achieved,
Which leads to true and full awakening; (165)
And so the aims of helpless mundane beings,
Who seek the fruits of perfect liberation.
Just this taught in the Māyājāla is
The noble path that leads to excellence: (166)
With largeness, vastness, and profundity,
With meaning great, achieving beings’ aims,
Just this comprises every buddha’s sphere,
Just this is taught by all awakened ones. (167)
