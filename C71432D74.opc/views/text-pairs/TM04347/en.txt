Prayer for the Dawning of Clear Light
The mere thought of you banishes the anxieties of existence and quiescence,
Glorious guru, beacon who dispels the darkness,
Take your seat upon the lotus in my heart
And inspire the dawn of naturally arisen clear light.
I have been subject to the murky gloom of delusion,
A nescience that’s endured throughout beginningless time.
Now, in your kindness, O precious guru, inspire me
To realise how your wisdom and my mind are indivisible.
Let my own clear, empty awareness dawn as the guru’s wisdom—
Profound, peaceful, unelaborate and ucompounded clear light.
Inspire me with the ability to focus my mind inseparably
On the white A, syllable of the unborn, blazing in radiance.
Let its light illuminate the whole world, outer and inner,
Environment and inhabitants, in wisdom luminosity,
And purify the dark of slumber and ālaya into basic space.
Inspire me to recognize both coarse and subtle luminosity.
Untainted by the obscurations of dualistic thought,
In a clear state wherein all perception, pure and impure,
Is experienced without any clinging to a self,
Inspire me to gain the stability of familiarity.
Inspire me, glorious guru of my own awareness,
So that through such diligent application,
I may gain liberation in this life or recognize the bardo’s clear light
And directly realize the truth of dharmatā.
