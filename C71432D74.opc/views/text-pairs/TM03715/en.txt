Prayer for the Long Life of Pewar Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Through the blessings of the three unfailing precious Jewels,
May the life of this great Lord, who, through vajra-like samādhi,
Opened the great treasury of the natural state, the clear light beyond death,
Remain forever stable, and may all his wishes be spontaneously fulfilled!
