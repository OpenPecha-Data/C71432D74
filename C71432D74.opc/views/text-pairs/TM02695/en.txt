Calling the Guru from Afar
O guru, watch over me!
O guru, watch over me!
O guru, watch over me!
Lord of all buddha families,
Chief of all maṇḍalas,
Sovereign of the whole animate and inanimate world,
Glorious protector of all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Gracious root guru,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
As I’m enshrouded in the darkness of ignorance,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
As I fail to consider the approach of death,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
As I’m attached to food and clothing,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
As I’m incapable of forming resolve,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
Lord of refuge, aside from you,
I have no other source of hope.
In this life, the next and the bardo state,
Look upon me with eyes of compassion.
