Advice for Palpung Situ Rinpoche
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Ordinary awareness, momentary cognizance,
Present knowing that’s not been modified—
As long as its stability hasn't been lost,
Simply because it hasn’t slipped away,
There’s no room for going astray.
Do you understand, my heart-son? 
It is well known that this was given to Palpung Situ Rinpoche.
