The Swiftest Blessings
In Praise of the Wisdom Ḍākinī Niguma
by Rongtön Sheja Künrig
Homage to the guru and the hosts of ḍākinīs!
Embodiment of compassion for limitless beings,
Your wisdom realization of emptiness perfectly complete,
Lady who miraculously courses through the sky,
Although your qualities defy expression, I shall declare a few. 
The flowing nectar of your instructions perfectly purifies
Each and every flaw, O lady endowed with a valorous mind,
You afford protection from all the sorrows of life and death,
And in your magnificence you surpass even the outstanding. 
Perceiving the drumbeat of your awakened speech
Brings waves of understanding in the ocean of the mind,
And together with the sun of non-conceptual samādhi,
The light rays of co-emergent bliss shine forth. 
Through your speech’s radiance throughout this land,
Numerous disciples have attained wondrous realization.
Treasure-like source of inexhaustible beneficent activity,
Merely to think of whom brings blessings—to you I bow. 
Through the abundant merit accrued by praising you,
May we find the path to liberation and attain samādhi. 
The great Rongtön composed this at Pal Nālendra.
