Anguished Prayer to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
Namo guru!
Peerless guru, the Lord of Sages,
Mañjughoṣa, Maitreya, Vajrapāṇi, Avalokiteśvara and the rest,
Possessors of great, non-referential compassion,
Victors and your heirs, turn your attention towards me.
Kyema! Sentient beings like me possess such evil karma.
Our bodies are racked by various forms of illness,
Our speech is like a treasury of the non-virtuous,
Our minds are drowsy, dull, torpid and forgetful.
May the victorious ones and their heirs
Look with great compassion upon the deluded nature of our three doors,
And their tendencies which lead to states of misery.
I know a little of what to adopt and to avoid,
But my vigilance is as if intoxicated by the kleśas,
And I am helpless—O buddhas and bodhisattvas,
Protect me, I pray, wretched as I am.
Stop the process of karma and the kleśas
And dispel the dense darkness of saṃsāra!
Open the way to light through your wisdom rays,
And reveal to me, I pray, the undeluded state,
The profound nature of reality, exactly as it is.
Kyema Kyihü! O compassionate conquerors,
Lead me from the mire of existence, here and now,
And guide me along the path of supreme awakening.
Cleanse and purify the stains of my obscurations,
Help me to experience the qualities of realization,
And cause me to attain the kingdom of the four kāyas!
