The Swift Infusion of Blessings A Guru Yoga of the Great Embodiment of Unchanging Awareness Wisdom
Emaho!
In the sky before me is an expanse of rainbow-coloured light,
With vast, cloud-like gatherings of dralas and deities of the Three Roots,
Out of which appears the Supreme Being, Gesar Norbu Draddul Tsal,
Inspiring, replete with blessings, and smiling with joy.
Protector, embodiment of all the Buddhas, Compassionate One,
Nirmāṇakāya emanation of the great and glorious Orgyen,
Lord, who embodies the three buddha families, great lion Gesar,
Like a child, in a state of intense and fervent devotion,
I pray to you, my kind father, from the depths of my heart.
In your wisdom mind, which never parts from the state of clear light,
Great clouds of loving kindness and compassion are amassed now and for ever more,
And for the disciples with the right karma and aspirations from the past,
Your compassion brings down a powerful rain of blessings and inspiration.
Even within the battle dress and armour of the brave drala warriors,
Appear countless mandalas of the deities of the Three Roots—
Merely by thinking of you all, we are inspired with great and powerful blessings.
The male warriors perform their imposing dance of war,
The female warriors sing their captivating songs,
The horses pant and neigh excitedly,
And the brave dralas bellow with laughter.
For us, whose minds are filled with devotion and joy,
Do not neglect your promises and commitments, but grant us your blessings—
Make our bodies a stronghold of drala warriors,
Empower our speech with miraculous force,
And arouse in our minds the awareness-power of bliss and emptiness!
Make us one with you, Lord Gesar, forever inseparable!
O lama, care for us!
O lama, Great Being, Wish Fulfilling Jewel, care for us!
