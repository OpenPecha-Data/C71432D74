Pointing Out Instruction
by Situ Paṇchen Chökyi Jungne
Śrī gurubhyaḥ! 
Yogi, you who diligently apply yourself to the practice,
You said, ‘I need an instruction on mind’s nature.’
And in response, this is what I have to say:
Mind is empty, without basis or origin;
And no-one has ever found its essence.
In the natural ease of not finding through searching,
There is no distinction of how it is or is not.
Beyond any doubts, ideas or mental activity,
There is simply a deep space of inner conviction.
I wonder: isn’t this the onset of the natural state?
Appearances of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arise in various ways.
And, when sustaining a state in which they simply appear without grasping,
If, without any particular aim or focus, they should appear insubstantial,
This is what is called the illusory yoga of post-meditation.
By simply meditating like this as an indivisible unity,
When experiences are purified into the natural state,
That marks the attainment of awakening.
Śubham.
