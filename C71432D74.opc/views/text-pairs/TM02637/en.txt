Bright Light of the Sun A Simple Fire Offering Based on a Single Substance
Namo guru deva ḍākinī
All negativity, obscurations, habitual tendencies and the results of karma
Of the beings on whom I focus in this practice—myself and others—
Are gathered and absorbed into the sesame seeds.
The maṇḍala of fire in front of me becomes white Vajrasattva,
With one face and two hands holding vajra and bell,
He wears his ornaments and sits cross-legged –
Burn away the negativities and obscurations offered into your mouth!
oṃ vajra satva hūṃ | sarva pāpaṃ dahana śāntim kuru svāhā
arghaṃ pādyaṃ puṣpe dhūpe āloke gandhe naivedye śabda
Sovereign Heruka who embodies all families,
Utterly white holder of vajra and bell
Who has the power to purify karma and obscurations,
Vajrasattva—I offer prostration and praises to you!
My own and others'—every beings’
Habitual tendencies based on binding ourselves with grasping at the self,
And the results of our karma which are the fruits of the five poisons—
Burn them all away in the wisdom fire!
Cleanse and purify them!
Vajrasattva in front dissolves into me.
May we realize the primordially pure dharmadhātu
And swiftly reach Buddhahood!
