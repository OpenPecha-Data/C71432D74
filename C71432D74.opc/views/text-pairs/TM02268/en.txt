Drops of Nectarous Advice
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 
Having paid homage at the feet of the guru,
I shall impart some drops of nectarous advice. 
As you have the name of tulku—an emanated form,
You cannot be someone emanated through karma,
And must be a higher emanation born of compassion.
Still, as you might have flaws, obscurations from the womb and so on,
It is incumbent upon you to train in the path. 
For this, maintain the vows of ethical discipline,
The commitments that you have already made,
And when in future you receive the vows of a bhikṣu,
The root of the teachings, guard them as you would your very own eyes.
For this serves as the foundation of all qualities. 
Now, when your mental faculties are bright,
Make every effort in study and reflection.
Consult without bias the works of sūtra and mantra,
And you’ll thereby gain the light of intelligence. 
Then, in order to overcome dualistic fixation
And gain freedom within the mind’s continuum,
It’s right that you put your energy into meditation
And discover the key to the profound meaning. 
In short, protect your very own mind
With stable mindfulness, vigilance and caution.
Distance yourself from nefarious companions,
And train to emulate the excellent lives of the sublime. 
These brief words of counsel
Constitute no more than the merest seed,
But you should also consider the more extensive
Pratimokṣa Sūtra, Bodhicaryāvatāra and the like.
