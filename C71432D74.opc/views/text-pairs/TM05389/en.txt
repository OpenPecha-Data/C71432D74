Three-Kāya Vajravārāhī Aspiration[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Ahoye!
In changeless dhūti sphere,
Dharmakāya Vajravārāhī;
United with great-bliss vīra,
As the supreme method,
The playful dance of bliss,
The sambhogakāya,
Bhagavatī Vajravārāhī;
All-taming illusory wisdom,
In Tibet, Land of Snows,
Dechen Gyalmo, queen of space,
Inseparable from the gracious guru,
To whom I offer heartfelt prayers. 
May I realize the self-abiding,
Indestructible vajra nature,
And as wisdom blazes forth
In splendour, may knots
Within subtle channels,
Energies and essences
Be released. 
From my heart, I pray:
Within this very life,
May I meet the right
Dependent circumstances
To attain the state
Of three-kāya Vārāhī.
