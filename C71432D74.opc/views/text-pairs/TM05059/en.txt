A Surge of Faith
Verses In Praise of Tārā
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti.
As white as a water lily,
Beautiful and noble in the Snowy Land,
Caringly you look upon sentient beings who are
Distressed by the demon of self and
Exhausted by the torments of chatter.
For you are elegantly attired,
Greatly renowned and omnispresent,
Having compassion that is swift.
In this moment, O noble Tārā,
Just now, carry out your activity, I pray,
Keep us from illness and the like.
Liberator, whose complexion resembles a lotus,
Magnetize everyone, including those who oppose us,
Nourish us and fulfil our wishes, just like a cow of plenty.
O loving mother who cares for all,
Put all forms of evil to flight,
Quell every torment here and now.
Reduce unruly forces to dust—
Sly, fox-like opponents and harmful influences.
Transfer everyone, including the infirm, to liberation.
Until then, do not neglect us even for an instant.
Vanquish every form of agitation and distraction.
Wondrous goddess,
X-ray-like in your movement,[1]
You travel everywhere high and low,
Zestful as a roaming deer
And stable as the earth itself—to you I pray:
Inspire me with your blessings, O noble Tārā,
So that with the sound of “Ha! Ha! Hūṃ! Hūṃ!”
I may realize the unborn, the meaning of A. 
Chökyi Lodrö offered this prayer on the fourth day of the fourth month in the Wood Mouse (1924).
