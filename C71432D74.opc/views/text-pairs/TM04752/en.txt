Daily Practice of Vajrasattva
Āḥ! Vajrasattva, great space,
Ungraspable as the moon in water,
Through the play of Samantabhadra,
The primary deity uniting method and wisdom,
The heroic being, white and holding vajra and bell.
Embracing Vajragarvā, his own radiance, who hold a knife and skull-cup,
And sitting with his two legs in the vajra posture.
At his heart, upon a moon-disc maṇḍala,
Is the syllable Hūṃ surrounded by the mantra,
It emits light that offers to the noble ones and purifies beings’ obscurations,
Then returns, bringing attainments, ordinary and supreme.
My mindstream is purified and I am infused with blessings.
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Vajrasattva, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach his state of perfection too.
