Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Homage to the Three Jewels!
The Blessed One was dwelling within the Vajra Palace 2 surrounded by a great assembly of monks and an assembly of innumerable vidyādharas. Just then, the Blessed One addressed the vidyādharas:
“Listen vidyādharas!
There is a deity called Vajraṇakhī.
She is the daughter of the sugatas,
The sister of the bodhisattvas,
And mother of the wrathful deities.
She is the foremost of ḍākinīs,
An ally of the vidyādharas,
And the sovereign guardian of the teachings.
She is the protectress of the Three Jewels,
Source of all siddhis,
And the queen who liberates demons and heretics.
Any vidyādhara who recites the dhāraṇī of this Vajra-Ḍākinī from memory will attain these fifteen qualities of excellence:

The qualities of this dhāraṇī are inconceivable:
Direct it at the ground and the ground will crack,
Direct it at a rock and the rock will crumble,
Direct it at a tree and the tree will wither,
Direct it at a stream and the stream will halt,
Direct it at a fire and the fire will perish,
Direct it at wind and the wind will stop.
What need then to mention the effect on conscious beings?”
Then Vajraṇakhī said to the Blessed One:
“In former times, countless eons ago, when I took the form of a woman, the Blessed One, the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the complete and perfect Buddha named Dṛḍhaśūraraṇasenapraharaṇarāja 19 appeared in the world. He placed his golden hand on my head and said: ‘Noble daughter, take this dhāraṇī, the essence of the Secret Mantra, and memorize it! If you do, in the future, you shall become renowned as Vajraṇakhī. In this form you will bring great benefit and happiness to all sentient beings. This dhāraṇī will grant you the power, allegiance, and siddhis of the vidyādharas. Vidyādharas who encounter this dhāraṇī have formerly made offerings to countless buddhas and nurtured the roots of virtue extensively. Thus they meet a spiritual friend according to their aspirations. Once they memorize and recite this dhāraṇī, they rise victorious over the three worlds. It will not be long before they take miraculous birth within a lotus in the realm of the buddhafield Sukhāvatī. Vidyādharas, recite this dhāraṇī three times during the day and three times at night. Thus all sentient beings will be fulfilled and act conscientiously in all actions. Have faith in me and your spiritual friends.’”
The Blessed One then commended the Vajraḍākinī:
“Awesome Vajraṇakhī, Vajra Claw,
In your wrathful form, you revel in infinite bliss,
And passionately embrace your wrathful consort.
Glorious ḍākinī in all your splendour: homage be to you!”
The ḍākinī then pronounced the samayas for this dhāraṇī:
“Respect your master and guard your empowerments and samayas.
Do not disseminate the pith instructions, but accomplish them secretly in solitude.
Do not wander among crowds or mingle with those of degenerated samaya.
Make offerings, oblations and feast offerings to the beings of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa during the four times.
Resolve through the view, practise meditation, and be faithful.
By maintaining the samayas, without rejecting the secret conduct, you will receive the siddhis.
Follow the oral instructions without prioritizing the pleasures of this life.
Learn to control your mind and pursue accomplishment.”
Thereupon the Blessed One approved the words of the Vajra Ḍākinī:
“Excellent, excellent indeed! Vidyādharas, you should gain conviction that it is so!”
When the Blessed One had said this, the great gathering of monks, glorious Vajraṇakhī and the great gathering of vidyādharas together with the whole assembly of gods, humans, yakṣas, rakshasas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas—all human beings and spirits—rejoiced and praised the speech of the Blessed One.
Thus concludes the Dhāraṇī of Glorious Vajraṇakhī.
