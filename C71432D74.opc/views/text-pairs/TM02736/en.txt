In the pure realm of five-colored light with the five essences,
Sambhogakāya guru, uncontrived natural clarity,
Vairocana Avalokiteśvara—I pray to you:
Bless me, so I may perfect the meditation of spontaneous presence!
In the expanse of the all-taming illusory web,
Nirmāṇakāya guru, great bliss itself,
Lotus Buddha—at your feet I pray:
Bless me, so I may bring spontaneous conduct onto the path!
In the secret treasury, the one taste of all,
Dhatviśvarī Tsogyal, Gentle Protector Tri Songdetsen,
And Divine Prince Damdzin—I pray to you:

In the palace of wisdom manifesting as all that is desirable,
Vidyādhara custodians of the teachings, fulfillers of prophecy,
Glorious root and lineage masters—I pray to you:
Bless me so that aims and wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled!
In the all-encompassing maṇḍala of spontaneously present space and awareness,
Circle of emanated Three Roots, host of servant Dharma protectors,
And loyal treasure-guardians—I pray to you:
Bless me, so I may attain the supreme and common siddhis!
May my basic potential be roused, that I may cultivate the field of my being.
May it mature through the seeds that ripen and the instructions that liberate.
By perfecting in this very life the direct vajra path,
May I easily attain the fruition of the five kāyas!
