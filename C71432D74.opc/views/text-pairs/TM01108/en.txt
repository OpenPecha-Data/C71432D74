Moonlight of Pacifying Amṛta A Daily Visualization and Recitation for the Dispeller of All Samaya Corruptions and Pollutions Refuge and Bodhicitta Visualization
namo gurūcchuṣmāya!
Namo! In the guru, the Three Jewels, and the yidam deity,
With deepest devotion I take refuge.
So that I and all beings, in numbers limitless as the sky, reach unsurpassed awakening,
I shall practice Ucchuṣma, ‘Desiccating Fire’.
oṃ mahā-śūnyatā-jñāna-vajra-svabhāvātmako ’ham ||
From the state of emptiness, instantly,
Upon lotus and sun disc seats, 1
I meditate upon myself as the great, wrathful Ucchuṣma,
Dark blue in colour and emanating rays of light,
With two hands at my heart displaying the threatening mudrā,
And complete with all the attributes of a wrathful heruka.
Through the emanation and reabsorption of syllables at my three centres,
I invite all the peaceful and wrathful ones and dissolve them into myself.
At my heart, upon a lotus and sun disc,
Is a seed syllable surrounded by the mantra, which whirls like a blazing firebrand.
As I recite the mantra, sparks flicker and shoot out
To burn away completely all harmful lapses and breakages of samaya.
Through this merit, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Ucchuṣma,
And thereby may every single sentient being
Likewise reach this state of perfection!
Once again, sparks of wisdom fire shoot forth
From the seed-syllable radiating light within my heart,
Incinerating all samaya corruptions and impurities.
Oṃ , the nature of Vairocana, is the celestial palace.
Āḥ , the nature of Amitābha, is the lotus and sun-disc seat.
Hūṃ is the complete visualization. Recite these syllables. 4
