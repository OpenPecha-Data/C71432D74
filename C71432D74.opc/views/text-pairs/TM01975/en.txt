A Brief Daily Practice of Damdrip Nyepa Kunsel The Preliminaries: Refuge and Bodhicitta Main Practice Conclusion
In the guru and Three Jewels, I take refuge.
For the benefit of all beings, I shall meditate on Ucchuṣma. 1
From the state of emptiness, instantly,
Upon lotus and sun disc seats,
I appear as the great wrathful Ucchuṣma,
Dark blue in colour and emanating rays of light,
With two hands at my heart displaying the threatening mudrā,
And complete with all the attributes of a wrathful heruka.
Through the emanation and reabsorption of syllables at my three centres,
All the peaceful and wrathful ones are invited and dissolve into me.
At my heart upon a lotus and sun disc is a blue syllable hūṃ,
Surrounded by the mantra, whirling like a blazing firebrand.
As I recite the mantra, sparks of flame flicker and shoot out
To burn away completely all harm and breakages of samaya.
Through this merit, may all defilements and impairments be eliminated,
So that all beings may enjoy the splendour of benefit and happiness.
