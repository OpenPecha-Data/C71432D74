The Words of Jigme Chökyi Wangpo
A Commentary Presenting the Subject Matter of the Great Treatise, Abhisamayālaṃkāra
by Khenpo Tsöndrü
Oṃ Svasti!
The great Sage and Lord of Dharma, Maitreya and Mañjughoṣa,
The three founders Nāgārjuna, Asaṅga and Śāntarakṣita,
Rongzom, Longchenpa, Jigme Chökyi Wangpo and the rest—
Gracious root and lineage masters, grant me your protection!
I will now present an overview of the main body of the great treatise known as Abhisamayālaṃkāra, as it is taught in the fifteen verses,[1] following the explanation of Jigme Chökyi Wangpo (Patrul Rinpoche).
In this, there are two main sections:
I. Briefly presenting the main body of the text by means of its principal subject to be elucidated, i.e. the eight topics; and
II. Elaborately explaining the body of the text by means of the seventy points that elucidate [the eight topics].
I. EIGHT TOPICS
This is also divided into a brief presentation and more elaborate explanation.
1. Brief Presentation
As it is said:[2]

The transcendent perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā)
Is perfectly explained by means of the eight topics. 

That is to say that the subject to be explained is the prajñāpāramitā, and the means of explanation, which will explain it perfectly, are the eight topics.
The prajñāpāramitā that is referred to here can be understood by means of the following five aspects: a) its literal meaning, b) its definition, c) illustrations, d) subdivisions, and e) the actual versus the nominal.
a) Literal Meaning
As it is said:

“It is the best (pra; rab) of all knowledge (jñā; shes pa), so it is wisdom (prajñā; shes rab). It is focused upon the absolute, and is the most sublime among all forms of wisdom, therefore it is transcendent (pāram; pha rol), and it has arrived at, or will lead one to (itā; phyin), non-abiding nirvāṇa.”[3]

b) Definition
Prajñāpāramitā is the wisdom of directly realizing the non-conceptual simplicity (spros bral) of all phenomena, which has arrived at, or will lead one to, non-abiding nirvāṇa.
c) Illustration
Any aspect of realization—gained through the three noble paths[4] of the mahāyāna—into the absence of true reality in all phenomena.
d) Subdivisions
The term [prajñāpāramitā] can refer to any of the following:


natural prajñāpāramitā
scriptural prajñāpāramitā
path prajñāpāramitā
resultant prajñāpāramitā


Their respective definitions and parameters are as follows:
1. Natural prajñāpāramitā is defined as the objective aspects of the wisdom that directly realizes the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena. It is synonymous with the ground prajñāpāramitā.
Parameters: It is present on the three noble paths of the mahāyāna.
2. Scriptural prajñāpāramitā is defined as any scripture—whether the Buddha’s own words or a treatise—whose primary topic of expression is the ground, path or resultant prajñāpāramitā. It is insight (rnam par rig pa) manifesting as the teachers’ words, expressions and letters. Illustrations include the seventeen ‘mother’ and ‘son’ prajñāpāramitā texts as well as Abhisamayālaṃkāra.
Parameters: It is present from before the path is entered until enlightenment.
3. Path prajñāpāramitā is defined as the wisdom that directly realizes the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena and leads to non-abiding nirvāṇa. Illustrations are the five mahāyāna paths, especially the paths of seeing, meditation and the final path (i.e. the path of no-more-learning).
Parameters: The actual path prajñāpāramitā is present in the equipoise of the noble followers of the mahāyāna, whilst a semblance of it is to be found in the mindstreams of those on the paths of accumulation and joining.
4. Resultant prajñāpāramitā is defined as the wisdom which has arrived at non-abiding nirvāṇa, the ultimate and most supreme direct realization of the non-conceptual simplicity of all phenomena. An illustration is the magical wisdom of non-duality at the level of buddhahood.
Parameters: It is present only in the continuum of a noble Buddha.
e) The Actual Versus the Nominal
Ācārya Dignāga says:

Prajñāpāramitā is non-dual wisdom,
The very state of a tathāgata.
Yet since they have this as their objective,
The term is also applied to the scriptures and the path.[5]

As he states, the ground prajñāpāramitā and resultant prajñāpāramitā are the actual (or definitive) prajñāpāramitā, whereas the scriptural prajñāpāramitā is merely given the name of prajñāpāramitā, and the path prajñāpāramitā has aspects of both the actual and the nominal.
2. Elaborate Explanation

Knowledge of all aspects, knowledge of the path,
Then the knowledge of all,
Completely perfect realization of all aspects,
Reaching the summit, the progressive,
Complete and perfect awakening in a single moment,
And the dharmakāya—these are the eight topics.[6]

As it says, the eight topics are as follows:


Knowledge of all aspects, which is to be attained
Knowledge of the path, which is the means of attainment
Knowledge of the bases, which is to be abandoned


These are the three aspects of wisdom that are to be known.

4. Application of all aspects
5. Culminating application

These are the cause and effect of gaining proficiency (dbang du bya ba).

6. Progressive application
7. Instantaneous application

These two are the cause and effect of stability.
Taken together, these last four are the four applications of practice.
The result of practising in such a way is:

8. Dharmakāya

Thus eight are taught.
Each of these is explained according to its definition, illustrations, subdivisions, parameters, definite number, sequence and a denial of any repetition.
1. Knowledge of All Aspects (or Omniscience)
Definition
Knowledge of all aspects (or omniscience) is defined as knowing directly, and in a single instant, all aspects, without exception, of things in their real nature and in all their multiplicity.
Subdivisions
It can be subdivided into the omniscience which knows the nature of things and the omniscience which knows all things in their multiplicity. An illustration of the former is the true cessation present in the continuum of the noble Buddha. The latter includes both the omniscience which knows the features of all knowable phenomena without exception, and the omniscience which knows the seventy points, the chief amongst all causes and effects.
Parameters
It is present only in the continuum of a noble Buddha.
2. Path-Knowledge
Definition
Path-knowledge is defined as the path of training that will lead us to realize the authentic limit of reality, once we have realized that the three paths are without any true reality and have perfected, matured and purified.
Subdivisions
When divided, there is the path-knowledge that knows the path of the śrāvakas, the path-knowledge that knows the pratyekabuddha path, and the path-knowledge that knows the path of the bodhisattvas.
Parameters
It is present on the five paths of the mahāyāna. It is also taught that it is present from the mahāyāna path of seeing until the state of awakening.
3. Base-Knowledge
Definition
Base-knowledge is defined as the limited knowledge that realizes all bases to be empty of the self of the individual.
Subdivisions
When the actual [base-knowledge] is sub-divided, there is the base-knowledge of the śrāvakas and that of the pratyekabuddhas.
If divisions are made according to how the term is applied, there are five: the base-knowledge that abides in neither existence nor quiescence, the base-knowledge that is distant from the ‘resultant mother’,[7] the base-knowledge that is close to the ‘resultant mother’, the base-knowledge that is unfavourable and the base-knowledge that is a remedy.
Parameters
The actual base-knowledge is present on the five paths of the hinayāna, but all the noble ones of the mahāyāna possess the nominal base-knowledge. It is also said that it is present in the mind-stream of all noble ones.
4. Complete Application of All Aspects
Definition
Complete application of all aspects is defined as the bodhisattvas’ yoga[8] of meditation in which one brings together the three types of non-arising in order to master the realization of the threefold knowledge.[9]
Subdivisions
When divided in terms of its essence and so on, there are twenty applications, and when divided in terms of its aspects, there are 173 subdivisions.
Parameters
It is present from the lesser path of accumulation until the end of the tenth bhūmi.
5. Culminating Application
Definition
Culminating application is defined as the bodhisattvas’ yoga that is based on the complete application of all aspects in which one has gained proficiency in the meditation combining the three types of non-arising.
Subdivisions
There are eight subdivisions: the four culminating applications of ordinary beings, the three culminating applications of the noble ones, and the mistaken practice to be eliminated.
Parameters
It is present from the stage of warmth until the end of the tenth bhūmi.
6. Progressive Application
Definition
Progressive application is defined as the bodhisattvas’ yoga in which one meditates on the aspects of the threefold knowledge sequentially in order to stabilize the realization in which the knowledge aspects of the threefold knowledge arise all at once.
Subdivisions
There are thirteen subdivisions: the progressive applications of the six transcendent perfections, the six recollections[10] and essential unreality.
Parameters
It is present mainly as an object of study and reflection from the path of accumulation onwards. The application produced through meditation is present from the stage of warmth [on the path of joining] until the end of the tenth bhūmi.
7. Instantaneous Application
Definition
Instantaneous application is defined as the bodhisattvas’ yoga in which one reaches the culmination of the progressive meditation on the threefold knowledge.
Subdivisions
Merely in terms of conceptual distinctions, it has four subdivisions.[11]
Parameters
It is present only at the end of the tenth bhūmi.
8. Resultant dharmakāya
Definitions
The resultant dharmakāya is defined as the ultimate fruition of practising the four applications, endowed with various undefiling qualities.
Subdivisions
It has four subdivisions: svābhāvikakāya, wisdom dharmakāya, sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya.
Parameters
It is present only at the level of buddhahood.
Definite Number
For an individual to awaken there must certainly be these three: the three aspects of knowledge to be known, the four applications of the path to be practised, and the result which is the dharmakāya.
The Summarizing Lamp says:

Three knowledges as objects to be understood,
Four applications at the time of meditation,
And the ultimate result that is dharmakāya.[12]

Moreover, the three aspects of knowledge are certainly three in number—the knowledge of all aspects which is to be attained, the path-knowledge which is the means of attainment, and the base-knowledge which is a potential pitfall.
Jowo Je, Glorious Atiśa said:

At the time of study and reflection,
There is complete ascertainment of the result,
The cause and any unfavourable factors.

The four applications too are fixed in number. There is the complete application of all aspects, the cause for gaining proficiency, which causes one to develop qualities that had not previously arisen in one’s mind, and its result, the culminating application. Then there is the progressive application, the cause for gaining stability, which enhances what has already arisen, and its result, the instantaneous application.
The Summarizing Lamp says:

At the time of meditation there is application,
Gaining temporary results, finding stability,
And perfection by reaching the limits of the causal.

The result of such practice is also fixed in number as the single dharmakāya.
Sequence
The sequence of the threefold knowledge is based on how they are explained, the sequence of the four applications is based on practice. The four applications and the dharmakāya are given in the sequence of cause and effect.
Denial of any Repetition
There is no repetition between the threefold knowledge and the complete application of all aspects, because the three knowledges each have their own particular aspects, whereas the complete application of all aspects is concerned with all aspects without exception. Moreover, since the first is taught as something to be known through various definitions and the second is taught as something to be applied in practice, they are not simply repetitions of the same thing. Yet again, there is no repetition since the first is presented as an object for understanding the nature of total peace and the second is given as a remedy by means of which one overcomes impurities.
The explanation of the various bhūmis and the paths of seeing and meditation in the context of the knowledge of all aspects and then their explanation in the context of the path-knowledge serve different purposes, and therefore there is no repetition. In the first case the explanation is given to illustrate the subject, the knowledge of all aspects, whereas in the second case it is given to illustrate the path-knowledge that knows the three paths by pointing out its objects.
The explanation of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha paths given in the section on path-knowledge is intended to illustrate the subject, path-knowledge. When they are explained in the section on base-knowledge, it is to point out the base-knowledge that is a remedy by means of which one can be free from conceptual projections. In the first case, the paths of  the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are taught indirectly by pointing out their opposites, and in the second case they are taught in their own right, so there is no repetition.
There is no repetition between the knowledge of all aspects and the dharmakāya, since they are taught by means of objects and result, or by means of illustration and essence respectively.
II. THE SEVENTY POINTS
Secondly, there is the elaborate explanation of the body of the text by means of the seventy points.
1. The Ten Factors that Illustrate Omniscience
It is said:

Generation of bodhicitta, spiritual instructions,
The four branches of definite separation,
The foundation of accomplishment—
The nature of the dharmadhātu,
The objects of focus, the objective,
The armour, the activities of engagement,
Accumulation, and definite emergence—
These are the Sage’s knowledge of all aspects.[13]

As it says, there are:


The generation of bodhicitta, which is the nature of the mahāyāna path,
The spiritual instructions, which are the method for attaining its objective,
The four aspects of definite separation, which come about as a result of the instructions,
The Buddha potential, the nature of the dharmadhātu, which is the basis for attaining accomplishment by practising the instructions unerringly,
The objects of focus for the practice,
The objective of the practice,
Armour-like practice,
Accomplishing the activities of engagement,
The practice of accumulation, and
The practice of definite emergence.


These ten factors point out the nature of omniscience, showing the result by means of its causes, or the subject by means of its objects, and mentioning the most important things to be understood.
The venerable Lord (Atiśa) said:

The result of perfecting the ten causes, omniscience itself.

The [Pramāṇa]vārttika says:

Knowing through this the total number of insects
Holds no purpose for us whatsoever.
It makes known the points to be adopted or avoided,
As well as the methods for doing so. 
This is held to be entirely valid,
Although it does not make everything known.
Whether or not one perceives distant things,
One perceives exactly what is required. 

1. The Generation of bodhicitta
Definition
The generation of bodhicitta is defined as a special type of mental consciousness endowed with two aspects, inspired by the cause, longing to bring about the welfare of others, and accompanied by the support, longing to attain complete and perfect awakening.
Subdivisions
In terms of its essence, it has two subdivisions: aspiration and application. In terms of its scope, it has three subdivisions: the king-like generation of bodhicitta with the great wish; the boatman-like generation of bodhicitta with sacred wisdom; and the incomparable shepherd-like generation of bodhicitta.
In terms of the stages on the paths, there are four subdivisions: the bodhicitta generation of ‘aspirational practice’ on the paths of accumulation and joining, the bodhicitta generation of ‘pure and excellent intention’ on the seven impure bhūmis, the bodhicitta generation of ‘complete maturation’ on the three pure bhūmis, and the bodhicitta generation of ‘great compassion in which all defilements have been relinquished’ at the level of buddhahood.

When divided in terms of purpose, there are the instructions given to prevent previously acquired qualities from dissipating, and teachings given for the sake of acquiring qualities not previously acquired.
When divided in terms of primary and secondary importance, there are firstly the texts of the Buddha’s own words and the treatises, which are special or primary instructions teaching the mahāyāna path and its result completely and unerringly, and there are also ordinary instructions which teach the mahāyāna path only partially.
When divided in terms of object, there are ten types of instruction, which instruct as to:

1) the essence of practice itself;
2-5) the objects of focus, which are the four truths;
6-8) the supports, which are the three jewels;
9) the aids, which are the three types of diligence,[15] and the results, which are the five eyes and six supercognitions; and
10) the grounds, which are the paths of seeing and meditation.[16]

Parameters
The authentic instructions are present from the greater path of accumulation of the mahāyāna onwards and an approximation of them is present from before the path has been entered until the level of buddhahood.
3. Aspects of Definite Separation

4. Potential
Definition
The potential is defined as mind’s actual condition, which is the nature of the dharmadhātu and the support for the thirteen types of practice mentioned here, and which, in its emptiness aspect, provides the cause[18] for the svābhavikakaya, and, in its appearance aspect, the cause for the rūpakāya.
Subdivisions
Divided in terms of its essence, there is the naturally present potential and the developing potential. When divided according to the various Dharmas it supports, there are thirteen.[19]

1. The Five Branches of Path-Knowledge
The five branches of path knowledge are as follows:


the support for generating path-knowledge, which is to be free from the hindrance of manifest pride;
the cooperative condition, generating bodhicitta, which makes the arising [of path-knowledge] certain,
the perpetuating cause, awakening the Buddha potential, which makes its development all-encompassing;

It is said:

Due to knowledge, not remaining in saṃsāric existence,
And out of compassion, not remaining in quiescence,
Distant because of being unskilled in means,
And not distant because of being skilled in means,
Unfavourable factors and their antidotes,
Application and its equality,
And the path of seeing of the śrāvakas and so on—
This is how the all-knowledge is described.[35]

As it is said, there are:


the base-knowledge of not remaining in saṃsāric existence due to wisdom,
the base-knowledge of not remaining in quiescence due to compassion,
the base-knowledge of being distant from the ‘resultant mother’ due to not being skilled in means,
the base-knowledge of being close to the ‘resultant mother’ due to being skilled in means,
the base-knowledge that is an unfavourable factor,
the base-knowledge that is an antidote,
the application of engagement,
the equality of application, and
the emerging result of the path of seeing.


That which is to be illustrated—all-knowledge—is asserted to be illustrated by these nine illustrating factors as above.
1. The Base-Knowledge of Not Remaining in Saṃsāric Existence due to Wisdom
Definition
The base-knowledge of not remaining in saṃsāric existence due to wisdom is defined as the wisdom that causes one to avoid the problems of saṃsāric existence with the knowledge that understands the absence of true reality.
2. The Base-Knowledge of Not Remaining in Quiescence due to Compassion
Definition
The base-knowledge of not remaining in quiescence due to compassion is defined as the wisdom that causes one to avoid the problems of quiescence through the force of generating the superior intention of bodhicitta.
3. The Distant Base-Knowledge Without Skilful Means
Definition
The distant base-knowledge without skilful means is defined as being bound by clinging to conceptual attributes in the three categories of (i) what is to be known, (ii) the path, and (iii) its result, and being unable to apply the antidote.
4. The Proximate Base-Knowledge With Skilful Means
Definition
The proximate base-knowledge with skilful means is defined as the wisdom that includes superior skilful means and wisdom.
5. Unfavourable Base-Knowledge
Definition
Unfavourable base-knowledge is defined as that which is to be abandoned by the bodhisattvas because it is restricted by a mistaken perception of the nature of the bases.
6. Antidotal Base-Knowledge
Definition
Antidotal base-knowledge is defined as the realization of the insubstantiality of the bases which acts as an antidote to clinging to their characteristics.
7. The Application of Base-Knowledge
Definition
The application of base-knowledge is defined as the path of meditation in which attachment to the bases such as form has been brought to an end, and which indicates, in an indirect way, the applications of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

4. The Eleven Factors that Illustrate the Application of All Aspects
It is said:

Aspects together with their application,
Qualities, faults, characteristics,
Factors conducive to liberation and definite separation,
The assembly of irreversible disciples,
The equality of saṃsāric existence and quiescence,
And unsurpassable pure fields,
These are the completely perfect realization of all aspects,
Together with the last one that is skill in means.[38]

As it is said, there are:


the aspects to be meditated upon,
the application of meditating on the aspects,
the qualities of meditation,
the faults that obstruct meditation,
the characteristics of application,
the path of accumulation, factors conducive to liberation,
the path of joining, conducive to definite separation,
the support, the assembly of irreversible disciples,
the cause of the dharmakāya, the application of the equality of saṃsāric existence and quiescence,

The co-emergent aspects of the four types of thought mentioned above.  ↩


1) Believing that the mental focus produced by the teaching on how all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena are devoid of reality is untenable because if it were tenable, it would be an object of dualistic perception. 2) Believing the method of realizing that all phenomena lack true reality is untenable because if there is a mode of realization there must be something that is realized. 3) Believing omniscient wisdom to be untenable because it is said that it does not focus on real or unreal entities, yet if it is omniscient it must have these two objects. 4) Believing the relative and absolute truths to be untenable because it is taught that in the essence of reality itself they are indivisible, and yet if there are two they must be separable. 5) Believing the trainings in generosity and so on to be untenable because it is taught that one should not conceive of a giver, gift or recipient, and yet if there is an object there must be all three. 6) Believing that the Jewel of the realized Buddha is untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to be realized. 7) Believing that the Jewel of the Dharma is untenable because it is taught that cessation and the path are merely imputations. 8) Believing that the Jewel of the Sangha is untenable because it is taught that all phenomena are beyond development and reduction. 9) Believing that a subject having skilful methods such as generosity is untenable because it is taught that there should be no conceptual focus on subject, object or action. 10) Believing that the Buddha’s realization is untenable because realization of real things, unreal things, both and neither is refuted. 11) Believing it is untenable to label the perception of the aggregates and so on as permanent and so on, because it is taught that notions such as permanent and impermanent are similar in being mere conceptual elaboration. 12) Believing the teaching that the bodhisattvas meditate on all three paths is untenable because it is taught that they do not manifest the fruition, the nirvāṇa of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. 13) Believing that the antidote is untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to adopt. 14) Believing that adverse factors are untenable because it is taught that there is nothing to abandon. 15) Believing that general and uncommon characteristics are untenable because it is taught that all phenomena are beyond characteristics and illustration. 16) Believing that practising a path with the attainment of omniscience as its objective is untenable because that which is to be cultivated lacks general and specific characteristics.  ↩
