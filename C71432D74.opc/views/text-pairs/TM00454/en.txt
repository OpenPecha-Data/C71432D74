Prayer to the Mañjughoṣa Guru, Sakya Paṇḍita 1
O Mañjughoṣa Guru Sakya Paṇḍita, so that I might carry out all the activity that delights you,
Mañjughoṣa Guru, embodiment of all sources of refuge,
With heartfelt faith, I prostrate myself before you.
I make offerings to you.
I take refuge in you.
I pray to you.
On the basis of this method, inspire me with your blessings, that I may perfect the twofold accumulation of three incalculable aeons within a single instant!
Inspire me with your blessings, that I may cleanse and purify all my misdeeds, obscurations, faults and downfalls, together with their habitual tendencies, right away within a single instant!
Let the blessings of the Mañjughoṣa Guru seep into my heart
And cause all the qualities of study, contemplation and meditation to be perfected within a single moment.
Inspire me with your blessings, that I may be able to benefit the teachings and sentient beings on a scale equal to space itself.
