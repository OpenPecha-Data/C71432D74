A Shower of Wisdom A Guru Yoga of Garab Dorje
Āḥ! At the crown of my head, upon a lotus and moon-disc,
Is the nirmāṇakāya emanation of glorious Vajrasattva,
Garab Dorje, brilliant white and with nirmāṇakāya ornaments,
Ablaze in splendour with the major and minor marks and hands in the Dharma-teaching mudrā.
I visualize him as the essential embodiment of infinite sources of refuge,
Supplicate with intense devotion from the core of my heart,
And consider that the blessings of realization are transferred from his wisdom mind.
Continuously, I recite this, the most profound essence of the Guru:
oṃ āḥ mahā guru prahevajra jñāna siddhi hūṃ
Through this I swiftly gain blessings, wisdom and attainments.
