Happiness and Suffering
by Mipham Rinpoche 
Happiness and suffering are equal by their very nature;
Dharma and non-Dharma are empty of essential identity.
As long as the movement of thoughts is not activated,
Everything is just like space, beyond benefit and harm. 
While remembering Tulku Rinpoche, this verse arose in my mind on the twenty-third day of the first month of the Water Dragon year.[1]

Reading drin bzhin as dran bzhin. "Tulku Rinpoche" here must refer to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo who passed into parinirvāṇa on the twenty-first day of the first month of the Water Dragon year (1892), two days before Mipham composed this verse.  ↩
