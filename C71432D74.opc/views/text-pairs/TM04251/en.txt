Praise to Mañjughoṣa
by Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa
Svasti.
Your form is as beautiful as the glowing golden clouds of a fresh dawn,
Your speech as sweet as the melodious voice of the immortal lord,[1]
Your mind as deep as the great liquid treasury of the sea —
Mañjughoṣa, father of the victorious, I bow to you in homage. 
To you, who for infinite aeons in infinite realms
Strove boundlessly to listen to countless teachings
From countless victorious ones, ultimately to become
The lord of incomparable knowledge, I bow. 
To you, who for as long as saṃsāra endures
Will remain to safeguard all careworn beings,
Peerless lord of compassion, undaunted
By the great burdens of sentient beings, I bow. 
Through setting down here, however inadequately,
A mere droplet from the ocean of wondrous deeds
Performed by the foremost bodhisattva in all realms
For the sake of beings whose number is as vast as space, 
May the venerable Mañjughoṣa always be a guide
Revealing the supreme vehicle in every lifetime, and
May he free the kind ones immersed in misery’s ocean
So that all may come to resemble Mañjughoṣa himself.
