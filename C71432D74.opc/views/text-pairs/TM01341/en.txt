Guru Yoga, the Consummate Blessing
by Khenpo Gangshar
Recognizing my mind to be beyond any and all elaboration, I take refuge in it, and pledge to place all confused beings, my mothers, upon the primordial ground.
Ā. The naturally pure citadel, the expanse of awareness beyond all elaboration and contraction; its expression unimpeded, appearing as any and everything pervading both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa; it is the very wealth of their being. [Relax] Without grasping within this expanse of empty awareness: Āḥ.
Sustain this, the immediate and direct ordinary mind, nakedly and devoid of all contrivance; empty awareness, both clear and uncompounded. Get to know this as the actual mind of your glorious guru. 
Gangshar Wangpo wrote this at the request of Lama Mardri, one endowed with the three higher trainings.[1]
