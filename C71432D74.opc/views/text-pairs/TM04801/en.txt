The Brightly Smiling Lotus A Prayer to Sarasvatī
On the ever-so-supple surface of a blossoming hundred-petalled lotus
The ever-so-beautiful Sarasvatī, captivating with her signs and marks,
Is seated amidst a mass of rainbow light that is ever so brilliant:
Direct your ever-so-dazzling smile of delight towards me.
Your noble face resembles the full moon that is ever so bright.
Your divine voice accompanied by the sound of the vīṇā is ever so sweet.
The love with which you regard all beings as your children is ever so tender.
Hold deluded ones like me, the ever-so-foolish, in your compassion!
May I master the fields of knowledge that are ever so numerous
And realize the ever-so-profound intent of the sūtras and tantras
With a mind that is ever so wise, skilful and excellent,
And raise ever so high the victory banner of the teachings.
As, with the intention to lead all beings, ever so incalculable in number,
To the supreme state that is ever so blissful,
I strive ever so hard to complete the two accumulations,
Help me to become an ever-so-excellent guide, supremely victorious!
