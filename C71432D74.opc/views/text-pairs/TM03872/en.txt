Praise of the Lords of the Three Families
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti!
You dispel the darkness of wrong view,
And open the lotus of perfect intellect,
Seeing all knowable things as they truly are –
Mañjughoṣa, to you I pay homage!
With great love, you look upon us,
And bring freedom from suffering's shackles,
Always acting for beings' welfare –
Great Compassionate One, to you I pay homage! 
You wield the vajra weapon in your hand,
And eliminate all the evil hosts of māra,
You are the powerful, the wrathful –
Vajrapāṇi, to you I pay homage!
Through the virtue of offering this praise
To the master-protectors of the three families,
May I and all other sentient beings
Attain the level of enlightenment!
