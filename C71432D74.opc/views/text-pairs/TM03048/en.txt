A Prayer to Shower Down the Rain of Wisdom
Great paṇḍita Vimalamitra, crown jewel of five hundred scholars,
Who attained rainbow body of great transference—
To the guru who obtained the deathless wisdom body,
I pray from the core of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!
The one who perfected the essence of the path of the generation and perfection stages,
Lord of accomplished yogins—
To the vital pillar of the teachings of definitive meaning, Melong Dorje,
I pray from the core of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!
Sovereign of all the siddhas of this degenerate age,
Sun of the teachings of the essence of clear light,
The noble Lord of Dharma entirely without equal—
Kumārarāja, at your feet I pray!
Single embodiment of the wisdom and compassion of all the buddhas,
Sovereign of all the teachings, Longchenpa—
To the omniscient master, a second lord of sages for the north,
I pray from the core of my heart: transform my mind with your blessings!
Intentional manifestation of Divine Flower of Brahmā, who was Mañjuśrī in person, 1
Lord of siddhas and paṇḍitas,
Rangjung Dorje Pema Wangchen — 2
To you I pray from the core of my heart: transform my mind with your blessings!
Through the power of praying reverently to all these holy beings,
May the wisdom of realization arise from within my mind,
May the wisdom of the nature and extent of all things be perfected,
And may the welfare of all beings be effortlessly and spontaneously accomplished!
