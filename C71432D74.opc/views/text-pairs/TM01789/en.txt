Gentle Rain of the Nectar of Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of Sogyal Rinpoche
In the expanse of dharmakāya, beyond extremes, where all conceptual elaboration is pacified,
From the unceasing great bliss of the saṃbhogakāya mandala,
Arises the nirmāṇakāya, the ‘Lake-born buddha’, Padmasambhava—
Grant us, we pray, a joyful feast of virtue, universal and everlasting!
From the indestructible moon of buddha nature—the wisdom of all the Victorious Ones,
You shine your cooling light—the rays of billion-fold acts of merit,
And like the moon that nurtures the night-flowering jasmine, you alone preserve and uphold the Buddha’s teachings—
Protector in this dark night of the degenerate age, may your life be long!
In the vast, spacious earth of the two accumulations you gathered in the past,
The roots of your great and noble aspirations are firmly planted,
And you are replete with the abundant fruit of supreme and ordinary siddhis—
Vidyādhara, you who are like a wish-fulfilling tree, may your life be long!
All over this world, in many lands, east and west,
According to the aspirations of those fortunate ones with stores of merit,
You reveal the nectar of Dharma, teaching in timely and appropriate ways—
You who are skilled at raising the victory banner of the Buddha’s teachings, may your life be long!
Through the blessings of the Three Jewels, who are unfailing,
The strength of mighty oath-bound Dharma protectors and guardians,
And the power of the utter purity of the dharmadhātu,
May the meaning of this aspiration of ours be instantly and effortlessly effected!
