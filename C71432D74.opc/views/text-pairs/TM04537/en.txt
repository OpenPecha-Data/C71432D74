Prayer to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal
Amidst the waves of the Lord of the World’s compassion 1
Blossoms a thousand-petalled lotus of all the buddhas’ wisdom and love,
Radiating the sweet fragrance of benefit and happiness—
Ngawang Namgyal, at your feet I pray.
In your wisdom, you conquer the darkness of ignorance;
In your love, you never forsake the welfare of others;
In your power, you overcome the forces of Māra—
Supremely divine Ngawang Namgyal, at your feet I pray.
To liberate sentient beings from the three realms of saṃsāra,
Having perfectly attained the supreme, immortal vajra-kāya,
May you bring benefit through the four kinds of activity
And remain forever, as long as existence itself endures.
