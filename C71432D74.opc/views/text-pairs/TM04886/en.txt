Taking the Vows of Sojong
In the Buddha, Dharma and supreme assembly,
I take refuge until I attain awakening!
In order to secure my own and others’ welfare,
I generate the spirit of awakening!
All my misdeeds I hereby confess,
And I rejoice in all that is meritorious.
The eight branches of noble sojong (healing and purification),
I now take on and uphold!
Blessed one, turn your attention toward me, I pray!
I, the one called insert your name here ,
From this moment on,
Until the light of the sun appears,
Shall wholly renounce
Taking life, stealing others’ possessions,
Sexual misconduct, speaking falsity,
Inebriation, conveyances,
Meals at improper times,
Colourful garlands, singing and dancing,
High seats and the like.
I take on the eight qualities of the noble ones
And this pledge and commitment to the rules of sojong,
I take this as an ornament of mind, a mental requirement—through this light,
May I reach ultimate buddhahood in the supreme assembly of practitioners!
I generate this mind set upon supreme awakening,
And invite all sentient beings as my guests.
Having practised supreme, delightful enlightened action,
May I attain enlightenment in order to benefit beings!
