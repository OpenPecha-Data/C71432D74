A Daily Practice of Noble Lady Tārā
Namo guru ārya-tārāyai!
Namo . I and all other beings take refuge in the Three Jewels
From now until the attainment of awakening.
In order to bring benefit to beings,
I shall meditate on Ārya Tārā.
In the Lotus-Arrayed Pure Realm, 1
Surrounded by wondrous clouds of offerings,
Perfect in the moment of recollection,
I am Noble Lady Tārā, green in colour.
Her right hand is in the gesture of supreme generosity,
Her left hand in the gesture of granting refuge, symbolizing the Three Jewels, is
Holding a blossoming utpala flower.
She is adorned with silks and jewelled ornaments and
Seated cross-legged in bodhisattva posture
On a white lotus and moon-disc seat.
At her three places are oṃ , āḥ and hūṃ
And at her heart-centre upon a moon-disc is a green tāṃ .
Light shoots forth from these syllables
And invites the wisdom beings, similar in appearance,
Who then dissolve into myself, merging indivisibly.
From the anti-clockwise spinning mantra,
Surrounding the syllable tāṃ at my heart,
Light-rays stream forth and then gather,
Making offerings to the noble ones, dispelling beings’ suffering,
And purifying clinging to ordinary appearances and its cause.
Sights, sounds and thoughts are experienced as
The display of the Noble Lady’s three secrets.
oṃ tare tuttare ture svāhā
oṃ tare tāṃ svāhā
The deity and my own mind are inseparable.
This is the innate, ultimate form of the Noble Lady.
Appearances arise as the play of the wisdom maṇḍala.
This is the great indestructible protection.
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Noble Lady Tārā, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach her state of perfection too.
