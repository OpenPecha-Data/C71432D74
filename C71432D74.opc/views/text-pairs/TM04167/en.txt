A Prayer to the Three Stūpas of Nepal
Emaho! The blessings of the buddhas of the three times,
An inexhaustible treasury of miraculous relics,
The dharmakāya stūpa of Svayambhūnāth 1 —
With unshakable devotion, to you I pray!
Through the sublime blessings of the Buddha Kāśyapa,
The ḍākinī Samvarī and her sons,
Built this great stūpa to perfection—
Noble Jarung Khashor, to you I pray!
From the relic remains of bodhisattva Mahāsattva, 2
Who offered his body to the tigress,
Arose this stūpa, a supreme field of merit 3 —
To you, with confidence I prostrate and with devotion I pray!
My body, my possessions and all the virtue I gather throughout the three times,
All of them, I offer, as Samantabhadra’s offering clouds!
I prostrate, confess my misdeeds, rejoice, and request the Dharma and pray that you remain—
Through this accumulation of merit, may we attain the great awakening!
May I and others, throughout all our lives,
Attain a rebirth in a higher realm! May renunciation, discipline,
Love, compassion, supreme bodhicitta,
And the authentic view awaken in our minds!
May the Buddha’s teachings spread far and wide!
May beings’ happiness and joy increase and their misery be dispelled!
May all harm to the teachings be completely pacified!
And may the lives of the holders of the teachings be ever secure and stable!
