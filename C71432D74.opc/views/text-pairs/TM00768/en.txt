Sweet Song of Enduring Deathlessness
Oṃ svasti!
Your name alone bestows sublime immortality,
You have seven wisdom eyes and a radiant form,
And your speech is melodious in all its expressions—
Exalted Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, look upon me with compassion!
Nirmāṇakāya with the blessings of the Mañjughoṣa guru,
Who reveals the path of excellent Dharma understanding
And raises the victory banner of teaching and practice in the ten directions—
Glorious guru, I pray that your lotus feet may long remain secure.
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
May any obstacles to the precious guru’s longevity be pacified,
May the lotus garden of happiness and wellbeing for the teachings and beings bloom,
And may guru and disciples remain inseparable until awakening!
