Prayer Composed for Yakzé Tsewang Gyurme
Namo guru!
Primordial protector Samantabhadra, universal splendour of existence and peace,
Appearing as a friend to dispel the darkness from my mind in this degenerate age,
Dance-like emanation of the Mañjughoṣa Guru’s 1 pristine wisdom,
Lodrö Gyatso, at your feet I pray.
Until I awaken, hold me in your care without ever parting.
As I call out to you with intense and ardent devotion,
May I realize the dharmakāya luminosity of awareness and emptiness,
And may I attain the vajrakāya, the rainbow body of great transference.
