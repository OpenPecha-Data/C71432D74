Guru Yoga
Hūṃ! My own rigpa manifests as the heaven of Akaniṣṭha.
There, in the supremely secret palace of great bliss,
Amidst spontaneously arisen wondrous clouds of offerings,
Presides the glorious Vajradhara Guru,
Complete with all the adornments of a yogin,
And emanating a great gathering of ḍākas and ḍākinīs.
He is the embodiment of all the three kāyas,
His vajra body the inseparable union of samayasattva and jñānasattva.
In a state of rigpa, I offer homage and prostrations.
Great gatherings of offerings, arising within the ground of appearance and existence, I offer.
All dualistic perceptions I confess in the expanse of primordial purity.
I rejoice in the great primordial liberation.
Grant the supreme empowerment of confidence in direct realization, I pray.
Turn the wheel of Dharma revealing the meaning of self-liberation.
Remain within the great, all-encompassing equality of experience.
May I attain awakening, my mind and yours inseparably united.
Hūṃ! Hūṃ! Samantabhadra, Padmākara, wrathful Dorjé Drolö,
Düddul Lingpa, 1 Dudjom Tsal, 2
Tenpé Nyima, 3 Lerab Lingpa and the rest— 4
All you masters of the lineage of the ultimate heart essence,
To you I pray! Shower down your blessings!
May all my dualistic perceptions vanish like clouds in the sky!
May I realize directly, here and now,
The face of the dharmakāya guru, my very own rigpa.
And may I seize the stronghold of the three kāyas that abide within myself.
Grant your blessings, I pray, so that through the vast blessings of the activity that is rigpa’s very own power,
All beings everywhere may find perfect liberation.
