The Sunlight of Pure Perception[1]
by Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol
Due to the kindness of holy forefathers of the past,
In the snow ranges of Tibet
Many profound Dharma teachings spread.
However, Dharma practitioners,
Having grasped the teachings as contradictory – like hot and
cold,
Engage in sectarianism – attachment and aversion. 
Some of the Holy Ones have said
That Madhyamaka, Dzogchen and Mahāmudrā
Are like sugar, molasses, and honey –
Each being as good as the other. 
Thus, I have listened to and contemplated
On all the teachings without sectarian bias.
Sectarian practitioners with attachment and aversion
Please do not scold me. 
When the sunlight of pure perception
Spreads on the lofty white snow mountains
That are Madhyamaka, Dzogchen and Mahāmudrā,
It is certain that a river of blessings will arise.
