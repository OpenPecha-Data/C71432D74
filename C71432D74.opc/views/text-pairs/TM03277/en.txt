The Fulfilment of Wishes and Aspirations A Prayer to Ācārya Padmasambhava
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Natural dharmakāya, the vast expanse of clear light,
Unceasing, spontaneously perfect saṃbhogakāya,
And nirmāṇakāya Padmākara, the expressive power of compassion—
Lake-born Vajra, at your feet I pray!
Tötreng (‘Skull Garland’) of the five families, the hundred supreme emanations and the rest—
Your peaceful and wrathful guises that cater to beings’ needs defy the imagination
And fill the whole of space and time, O Guru of Great Bliss,
Universal splendour of the oceanic three roots, to you I pray!
Vanquisher of unruly damsi demons in this age of degeneration,
Terrifying and awesome, you possess the nine modes of expression,
O wrathful Padma with your garlands of flames,
Subduer of the eight classes of arrogant spirits, to you I pray!
In your enlightened form you embody an ocean of victorious sugatas,
Your enlightened speech, with the voice of Brahma, pervades an ocean of realms,
And your enlightened mind is the immovable, primordially pure sphere, profound and clear—
Guru who embodies all three kāyas, to you I pray.
Great and valiant one, a brother to all ḍākinīs,
Vajra Tötreng Tsal, guru of my own awareness,
In the knowledge that you embody all sources of refuge,
I pray to you with fervent longing day and night,
Listen to me as I do so, O guru, with your vajra-like hearing,
Consider, with your knowledge and love, this suppliant child,
Shower down your great blessings of vajra body, speech and mind,
And dispel the threat of harm from demons, enemies, obstructing forces and elemental spirits!
Pacify all obstacles, fulfil my every wish and aspiration,
And bestow supreme and ordinary siddhis, I pray.
Let all be auspicious so that the teachings of the Victorious One flourish and spread,
The turmoil of sickness, famine and warfare is pacified, and virtue fills the whole world.
