Light Offering Prayer
With a boundless array of lamps of divine material,
Capable of illuminating a thousand million worlds,
I make offerings to the gurus, victorious ones and their heirs,
Who dwell throughout the infinite realms of the ten directions.
Through the virtue of this, may I cast aside past misdeeds and downfalls
And clear away the darkness of cognitive and emotional obscurations.
May I gain the supreme illumination of supernatural vision and perception,
And benefit on a vast scale to incalculable numbers of beings.
From now on, throughout all my lives to come,
May I hold the Dharma treasury of all the victors,
And through the light of unadulterated Dharma,
Banish the darkness of beingsâ€™ confusion.
Meanwhile, may I cleanse the eyes that see what to adopt and avoid,
Dispel disorders caused by an imbalance of wind, bile and phlegm,
Purify contamination brought about by breakages of samaya,
And clear away every form of obscurative defilement.
