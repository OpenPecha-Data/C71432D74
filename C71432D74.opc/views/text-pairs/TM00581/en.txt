Just Like the Waxing Moon[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Having paid homage at the guru’s feet,
To reflect on impermanence and death
And cultivate disgust for saṃsāra
Is renunciation, the root of the Dharma. 
Recognizing all beings as your parents,
Abandon all selfish entanglements,
And, with a noble, unbiased intention,
Devote body, speech and mind to others’ wellbeing. 
Taking stable devotion for the root guru,
The thought of whom is sufficient, as a basis,
In the knowledge that generation and perfection
Integrate guru practice, meditate constantly. 
If, in short, with mindfulness, vigilance and conscientiousness,
You thoroughly apply yourself to disciplining your own mind,
All enlightened qualities of learning and realization
Will develop and increase just like the waxing moon. 
By Chökyi Lodrö.
