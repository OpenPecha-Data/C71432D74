Guru Yoga 1
Ah! In the sky before me, in an expanse of rainbow light,
Upon a lion throne, white lotus and full-moon seat,
Is my own root guru in the form of Orgyen Rinpoche,
'Prevailing Over All That Appears and Exists.'
In his heart is the guru Mañjughoṣa, orange, holding a sword and book,
And with a syllable dhīḥ at his heart that blazes with light,
From which five-coloured rays of light shoot out
To dispel all the darkness of confusion.
