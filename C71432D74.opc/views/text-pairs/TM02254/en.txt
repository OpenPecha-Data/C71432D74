Advice for Karma Chöchok[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
I pay homage at the feet of the guru. 
Hey, since the instructions of Buddhadharma
Were taught for the sake of training one’s mind,
Now that you’ve found this exceptional human form,
Do not waste it on meaningless pursuits! 
Hey, maintain your ethical commitments purely,
Train your mind in bodhicitta,
Cultivate compassion impartially,
And exert yourself assiduously in accumulation and purification. 
Hey, develop devotion and pure perception
For the guru in his immense kindness,
Abandon mistrust and wrong views,
And pray to him from the depths of your heart. 
Hey, meditate on the generation and completion phases in four sessions,
And strive to make approach and accomplishment flow continuously like a river.
Meditate regularly without grasping
On the view that is free from dualistic clinging. 
Chökyi Lodrö wrote this advice in which there are four 'hey's
By setting down whatever came to mind
In response to a request from the devoted student Karma Chöchok.
May it prove virtuous!
