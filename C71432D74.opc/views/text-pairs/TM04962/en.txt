A Song of Joy Written in the First Month
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
High above, in the divine Tuṣita realm
Dwells the glorious, invincible protector Maitreya,
And the victory drum of Mahāyāna Dharma resounds.
Where is there a happier place than that? 
Upon Mount Sumeru’s golden summit,
Where the thirty-three gods are at play,
And divine Śakra is surrounded by a retinue of princes,
Is the warrior Shalkar Bumpa.[1]
May that god afford us guidance and protection. 
In the heart of the southern continent of Jambudvīpa
Is the site of awakening for the victors of the three times,
Renowned as the glorious Vajra Seat,
Where the Mahābodhi temple is located.
What joy, what happiness to visit such a place! 
In the Land of Snows to the north
In the vicinity of the Potala mountain
Is where divine Jowo Śākyamuni resides,
And my aspiration is to visit repeatedly. 
This child, happy to be arriving there tomorrow,
Dances for joy and sings songs of merriment. 
Friendly gods will accompany us as we go,
Dharma protectors, guardians and wealth deities will welcome us. 
There is no greater happiness than this, is there?
Such feelings of delight! Such happiness! Ah la la! 
Written on the 27th day of the first month.
