Prayer to Reverend and Noble Tārā
Reverend guru, noble Tārā,
Guide us in your great compassion.
Cause me and all sentient beings, who are infinite in number,
To purify our negative actions, complete the two accumulations,
And master love, compassion, and sublime bodhicitta.
With the lion's roar of the truth of emptiness and interdependence,
Cause the genuine view to spread throughout the land of snowy peaks,
And let us swiftly attain the level of omniscience and the four kāyas.
Until this time, throughout all our lives to come,
May we gain the supreme support of the freedoms and advantages,
Expand our lifespan, merit, prosperity and intelligence,
Increase our progeny and descendants, who maintain
Noble character and excellent disposition, and through dharma and resources
Bring the splendour of prosperity to the two traditions, spiritual and temporal.
Please pacify the various forms of harm and adversity,
Such as the eight major and sixteen minor dangers.
And Noble One, ensure that by merely recalling you
We may fulfil our every wish and desire,
Expand our fortune, virtue and excellence like a lake in summer,
And effortlessly and spontaneously accomplish all that we aspire to.
Pacify all the ravages of time throughout this land,
Usher in a new golden age of universal happiness and joy,
So that all beings live in fraternal and sororal harmony
And always take the three supreme jewels as our guide.
