Prayer for the Long Life of Ringu Tulku Rinpoche
We pray for the long life of the one whose activity is unwavering,
Who has refined his character with the armour of pure conduct,
And who tirelessly contributes to upholding the great teachings
Of the Karmapa, embodiment of the Buddhas of the three times.
