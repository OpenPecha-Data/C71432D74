Advice for Damchö Gyaltsen[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
To Damchö Gyaltsen of Tsechu, whose mind is rich with virtue,
I received your letter together with the supporting gift of five rupees, and offer my good wishes for the accomplishment of all your aspirations in accordance with the Dharma.
Remember impermanence and death.
Strive to adopt and avoid actions according to their effects.
Contemplate the deficiencies of saṃsāra
And develop a wish to escape conditioned existence. 
With utterly pure samaya and vows,
Generate devotion for the guru,
Exert yourself in secret mantra, the approach and accomplishment of the yidam.
And thoroughly investigate[2] your own mind. 
The condition of mind-as-such is empty, beyond arising,
Its radiance, awareness, is naturally clear and unceasing.
Sustain continuously, without contrivance or distraction,
This nature in which the three kāyas are spontaneously present. 
In short, since for now at least you have gained
This support with its freedoms and advantages,
Do not be distracted by the apparent and delusive,
Instead, please turn your three doors to what is meaningful. 
Offered together with a sacred knot on the eleventh day of the ninth month by Chökyi Lodrö, who holds the name of Khyentse.
