Aspiration 1
Through the blessings of the infallible Three Jewels,
May my own parents be freed from the sufferings
Of saṃsāra’s lower realms and reborn in Sukhāvatī,
Where they may delight the protector Amitābha.
Through the force of all the virtuous deeds I have done
Throughout beginningless time until now,
May all sentient beings, my kind parents,
Be liberated from the cycle of saṃsāra.
May my mother and father, who gave me life and physical form,
And the teachers and instructors who showed me the path to freedom
Complete the two accumulations, purify their twofold obscurations,
And delight the omniscient King of Dharma.
May the patrons who have placed their trust in me,
As well as all those beings whom I have harmed,
And those who have brought harm to me
Complete the accumulations, purify the obscurations, and swiftly attain enlightenment.
May all sentient beings, led by those whom I have abused,
Whose flesh and blood I have consumed,
Whose lives I’ve cut short and whose fur and hides I’ve worn,
Swiftly attain omniscience in reliance upon me.
