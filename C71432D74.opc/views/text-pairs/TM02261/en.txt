Advice for a Sincere Disciple
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 
Homage to the noble gurus! 
Remember that this physical support, free and advantaged,
Will not endure but will perish at some point.
Having reflected on the tribulations of saṃsāra,
Remember to adopt and avoid actions according to their effects.
Visualize the guru, embodying the Three Jewels, upon your crown,
And take refuge with confident faith.
Recognise all beings of the three realms as your parents.
It’s crucial that you cultivate love, compassion and bodhicitta.
Apply yourself assiduously to accumulation and purification,
And pray to the gracious guru.
With the generation phase, purify attachment to ordinary perception,
And with the perfection phase, purify attachment to the deities’ magnificence.
The profound crucial point for both of these
Is not to alter the mind but to experience the union of clarity and emptiness
And settle undistractedly without fixation—this is the key.
Recite at all times Samantabhadra’s Aspiration to Good Actions,
And seal all sources of virtue with dedication, I beg you. 
Thus, Chökyi Lodrö offered this message
To a sincere disciple. May it prove virtuous!
