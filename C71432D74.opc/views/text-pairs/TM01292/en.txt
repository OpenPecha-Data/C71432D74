The Swift Bestowal of Blessings: A Guru Yoga Supplication
Ah! All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are primordially pure within the experience of pure awareness,
Within its unceasing self-radiance, an expanse of five-coloured wisdom light,
In essence you are the glorious Mañjuvajra,
And in form, you appear as the sole refuge, the wish-fulfilling jewel:
Brilliant white, with a radiant smile and paṇḍita’s attire,
With the mudrā of expounding the Dharma, holding a sword and volume of text,
Your two legs crossed as you radiate boundless rays of light.
All is vividly clear, an adornment of pure self-appearance.
In the pure realm of the great sacred site, the Five-Peaked Mountain,
The blessings of Mañjuśrī’s wisdom ripened in your mind—
Jigme Phuntsok, at your feet I pray!
Inspire me with your blessings: transmit the realization of the wisdom-mind lineage!
At the end, the guru becomes a sphere of five-coloured light,
Which enters the crown of my head and dissolves into the centre of my heart.
I obtain the blessing of becoming equal to
The guru in whom all the buddhas’ wisdom is combined.
