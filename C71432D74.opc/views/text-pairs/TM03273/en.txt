Prayer of the Wisdom Mind 1
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
The essence, the space of natural simplicity, beyond the ordinary mind,
Is our very own rigpa, the master the Lake-born Vajradhara.
Let us remain forever one with your enlightened mind’s expanse,
And perfect the great power of your wisdom mind!
Great master of Orgyen, embodiment of all masters, devas and ḍākinīs,
When we pray to you with conviction, devotion and yearning,
Then hold us close, without ever parting, throughout all our births,
And let all be auspicious for the aims of others and ourselves to be spontaneously fulfilled!
