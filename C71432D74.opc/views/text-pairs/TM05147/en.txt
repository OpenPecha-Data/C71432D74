The Lightning Bolt of Compassion A Short Prayer that Spontaneously Fulfils All Wishes (Sampa Lhundrupma)
Emaho: O wonder!
O Guru Rinpoche, in your glory you embody Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha; lama, yidam and khandro; and all the sugatas,
The sole refuge of beings, who are without protection in this dark age.
Your compassion is as swift as lightning, Tötreng Tsal.
Mahā Guru—wrathful Padma Heruka,
With fervent longing and devotion, we pray to you:
Avert enemies, döns , obstructing forces, obstacle-makers, curses and spells.
Bring all negative forces, gyalpo , senmo and jungpo demons, under your subjugation,
Grant your blessings so that all our wishes be spontaneously fulfilled.
