In the English language: The Means for Accomplishment 2 called ‘Blazing Wheel’
Homage to all buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus have I heard at one time the Blessed One was dwelling in Vajrāsana taming demons. At that time the assembly of vidyādharas and bodhisattvas asked the Blessed One:
“O Blessed One, there are many enemies and evil spirits before the attainment of the vidyādhara stages. What skilful means can we apply to exorcise them?”
The Blessed One replied:
“There is the mantra and means for accomplishment called Cakrajvalā, the Blazing Wheel. Take it, keep it, read it, and apply it. By merely reciting this mantra you will rise victorious over all evil ones. Thus you will conquer all evil and become fearless. The mantra is:
oṃ dhuru dhuru cakra | jaya jaya cakra | hana hana cakra | bhuru bhuru cakra | bhramara bhramara cakra | bhedu maṇi-cakra | jvala jvala cakra | saṃbhave gana naya sara cakra | sālaya sālaya cakra | nāgaśaya nāgaśaya cakra | baṃ baṃ cakra | hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ phaṭ | samanta-ghara cakra | dīpta cakra hūṃ phaṭ |
By merely reciting this mantra fierce si -spirits will be cleared away, and you will be liberated from the ‘ si -spirits of innumerable deaths’.” 3
