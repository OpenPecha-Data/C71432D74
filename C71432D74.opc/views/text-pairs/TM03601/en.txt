A Towering Cloud of Blessings A Lineage Prayer for the Rigdzin Tsadrup—the Root Practice of the Vidyādhara Padmasambhava
Primordially enlightened Buddha Samantabhadra,
Padmasambhava, the sugatas all combined,
Ḍākinī Tsogyal, collector of the sacred commands:
To you I pray—may I attain the enlightened body of unity!
Vairotsana, single eye of the world,
Dharma King, lord Tri Songdetsen, ‘Pure Flower of the Gods’,
Dorje Dudjom, master of the highest siddhi:
To you I pray—may I attain the enlightened body of unity!
Lerab Lingpa, opening hidden doors to profound treasures,
With your line of worthy Dharma heirs,
And infinite deities, ḍākinīs and protectors:
To you I pray—may I attain the enlightened body of unity!
May the blessings of gurus of the three lineages pour into my heart,
My mind be matured through empowerment, and my samaya be completely pure.
May I diligently practise the yogas of vajra body, speech and mind,
And definitively resolve this life, death and the bardo state!
Through the power of the crucial points of the great secret paths of method and liberation,
May I recognize the face of the three kāyas in awareness dwelling in the ground,
Keep nāḍī, bindu and prāṇa within the space of the central channel,
And perfect saṃsāra and nirvāṇa spontaneously in the vastness of dharmadhātu!
When rigpa’s primordial purity pervades, vast and ever present,
And wisdom’s radiance lights the inner space of kingly spontaneous perfection,
May I attain fruition then, as a sovereign seizing the throne,
And serve as leader to limitless wandering beings.
May the Dharma’s profound teaching spread through the entire world,
Millions of learned and realized beings fill the face of the earth,
Peace, happiness and altruism be experienced far and wide,
And the sun of auspiciousness shine forever, steadfast and unchanging.
