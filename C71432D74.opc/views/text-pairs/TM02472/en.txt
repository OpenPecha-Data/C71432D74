Aspiration for the World 1
Throughout these lands and everywhere upon the earth in general,
May the sufferings of disease, famine and warfare be entirely unknown, so that not even their names occur.
May observance of the Dharma, merit and prosperity increase,
And may there always be good fortune and well-being in abundance.
