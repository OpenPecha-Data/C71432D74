A Means of Offering Sur to the Damsi, Gyalgong and Others
Hūṃ hrīḥ!
I appear clearly as the wrathful Padma,
From whose heart arises Ṭakkirāja,
To summon before me the damsi and gyalgong
Of the deluded clinging to an “I” or a self.
This gift of the sur of flesh and blood expands
To become a vast, inexhaustible source of all that is desired.
Oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Kyé! Arisen from the pride of conceiving of a self
In conditioned existence, all you hosts of gyalgong ,
Take pleasure in this vast gift of mine,
And satisfied, give up all thoughts of harm
And embrace the spirit of awakening.
Do not remain here but go elsewhere.
If you do not depart but instead cause harm
Have no doubt that you will be annihilated
Through the power and might of wrathful Padma.
So abide by your pledges.
Bhūta gaccha!
