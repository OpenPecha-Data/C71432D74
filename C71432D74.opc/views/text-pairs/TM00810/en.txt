Prayer of Aspiration to the Stūpa “Bodily Sacrifice to the Tigress”
Namo! Before all you victorious ones and your heirs throughout the whole of space and time,
Including our own incomparable teacher, king of the Śākyas,
I bow down, presenting my crown-ornament to the dust at your feet—
May these, my prayers of aspiration, be fulfilled!
In the past, when the Lord of Sages was the bodhisattva Mahāsattva,
He offered his own body to the hungry tigress and her five cubs,
Prompting Indra, lord of the gods, to create this stūpa,
Wherein to place his remains—to you who acted in this way, I pray!
Through the blessings of prostrating, offering and praying
Here, before such an especially sacred object in this world of ours,
A supreme, venerable field for the accumulation of merit,
May I and all other beings swiftly attain awakening.
For as long as I remain here in saṃsāra,
May I take delight in altruistic actions,
And never tire, but remain secure in the armour of endurance,
Capable even of entering the unbearable flames of hell.
Maintaining all the victorious buddhas' ways of Dharma,
And venerating each and every buddha and bodhisattva,
May I thoroughly purify all the various realms,
And fully perfect all the qualities of the sugatas.
In short, by generating the intention of Mañjughoṣa,
And accomplishing his activity according to these aspirations,
May I lead all beings, who are as infinite as space,
To the level of Samantabhadra, the Ever Excellent!
