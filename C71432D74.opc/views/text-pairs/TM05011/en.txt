Prayer for the Swift Rebirth of Getse Gyurme Tenpa Namgyal 1
Oṃ svasti!
May the ocean of gurus, Three Roots and victorious ones,
And especially the great Vajradhara, lord of refuge,
Show the full force of compassion from the expanse of the dharma-sphere,
To reveal the moon-like appearance of an emanation.
As the sun of the Early Translation teachings sets beneath the western peaks,
We, the hosts of disciples to be trained, are left without protection.
Look lovingly upon us, the protectorless and destitute,
And return swiftly, we pray, in a supreme nirmāṇakāya form.
Immune to obstacles and the forces of Māra,
May you return as a genuine, exceptional emanation,
A guardian of the teachings of the Ancient Translations,
And bring vast benefit to the teachings and beings, we pray.
