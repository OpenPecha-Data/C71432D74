Concise General Offering to the Female Protector-Goddesses
Bhyo! Ekajaṭī, Queen of Existence, Rematī, Makzor Gyalmo,
Yudrönma, Tenma goddesses, Sokdrup Nakmo and the rest—
All you goddesses of the female class of appearance and existence,
I supplicate you and make offerings to you: protect and care for this yogi like your very own child!
