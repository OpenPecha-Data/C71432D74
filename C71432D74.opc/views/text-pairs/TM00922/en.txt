The Beautiful Garland of Uḍumbara Flowers A Prayer to the Previous Incarnations
Oṃ svasti!
Wisdom embodiment of all the buddhas and their bodhisattva heirs,
Sovereign ruler present throughout the whole of space and time,
Spontaneously arisen primal buddha, transcendent conqueror,
Lord and protector Mañjughoṣa, to you I pray!
Powerful master of wisdom, Mañjuśrīmitra,
Vimalamitra, who gained an indestructible vajra form,
Cakrasaṃvara in person, Vajraghaṇṭāpāda,
And the great paṇḍita Anantamukhamati, 1 to you I pray!
Dharma-king Tsangpa Lhayi Metok, 2
And the reincarnation Chokdrub Gyalpo, 3
Smṛtijñāna, 4 Nyangtön Nyima Özer, 5
And Chögyal Phakpa, 6 to you I pray!
Crowning jewel of siddhas, Milarepa,
Drikung Rinchen Pal, 7 Drimé Özer, 8
Medicine Buddha incarnate, Yuthok Yönten Gönpo, 9
And Sonam Gyaltsen, 10 to you I pray!
Vanaratna, 11 Gö Lotsawa Shyönnu Pal, 12

Great omniscient one in this troubled age, Jikmé Lingpa,
Lord of siddhas, Yeshe Dorje, 23 no different from
Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, recipient of the seven special transmissions, 24
And Jamyang Lodrö Gyatso, 25 to you I pray!
In this life and in future, until I attain enlightenment,
May I never be separated from you, my precious master,
May I always experience the nectar of your instructions, your secret speech,
And may my own and others’ welfare be accomplished spontaneously!
