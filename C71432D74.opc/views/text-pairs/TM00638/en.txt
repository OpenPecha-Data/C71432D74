Benedictory Verses for the Summary of the Perfection of Wisdom
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti.
May this precious essence of the long, medium and short
Dharma scriptures expressing Transcendent Wisdom,
The Mother who bears all the victors and their heirs,
A wish-fulfilling jewel-like summary, magically printed,
Bring many hundred signs of auspiciousness and virtue
And vajra-like victory in the battle with adversity.
And through the power of this positive deed,
Undertaken with such faith and diligence,
May we swiftly attain the level of omniscience. 
These words for the printer’s colophon were offered as a prayer of aspiration by Chökyi Lodrö. Siddhir-bhavatu! Maṅgalam.
