Sūtra of Boundless Life and Wisdom
Homage to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas!
Thus have I heard.
Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Śrāvastī, in Anāthapiṇḍada’s garden in the Jetavana grove,
Together with a great gathering of twelve hundred and fifty monks,
And a great gathering of many bodhisattva mahāsattvas.
At that time, the Blessed One said to youthful Mañjuśrī:
“O Mañjuśrī, above us lies a world called Boundless Qualities,
In which there dwells the tathāgata, the arhat, the completely and perfectly enlightened one called Boundless Life and Wisdom, the Utterly Discerning King of Splendour.
He protects life and extends longevity, and
He teaches the Dharma to sentient beings.
“Listen, O youthful Mañjuśrī!
The human beings of Jambudvīpa have short lives; they are only able to live for a hundred years and
The majority meet untimely deaths.
O Mañjuśrī, if people write out this section of Dharma praising the qualities of the Buddha Boundless Life and Wisdom, or
Encourage others to write it out, or
Merely hear its name, or
Read it aloud and copy it into a book which they keep in their home, or
Venerate it with offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, perfumed ointments and powders,
their lifespan will not be exhausted and they will be able to live a hundred years.
“O Mañjuśrī, if people hear the one hundred and eight names of the Buddha called Boundless Life and Wisdom, the Utterly Discerning King of Splendour,
Their span of life will be extended.
“Even those who are on the point of the total exhaustion of their lives,
If they keep these names in mind, will have their span of life extended.
“O Mañjuśrī, these will be the qualities and the benefits that come to any son or daughter of noble family who wishes to extend their life and who listens to these one hundred and eight names of the Buddha called Boundless Life and Wisdom, the Utterly Discerning King of Splendour, or who writes them, encourages others to write them, or reads them aloud.

“O Mañjuśrī, whoever writes these one hundred and eight names of the Buddha called Boundless Life and Wisdom, the Utterly Discerning King of Splendour, or
Encourages others to write them, or
Writes them in a book and keeps it in the home, or
Reads them aloud, will live for one hundred years without their span of life being exhausted.
And when they die, they will be reborn in a pure land such as the universe of Boundless Qualities, the buddha field of the Buddha of Boundless Life.”
