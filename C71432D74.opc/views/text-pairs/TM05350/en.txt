Vajrakīla Tsok Prayer from 'The Essential Drop of Enlightened Activity: A Tsok Offering for the Single-Mudrā Form of Vajrakumāra' 1
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
oṃ vajrakīli kīlaya saparivāra-mahāgaṇacakra-pūjā kha kha khāhi khāhi
Hūṃ! Great glorious Vajrakīla, along with all your retinue,
Accept this ocean of offerings!
We confess an ocean of impairments and breakages of samaya, without any omissions!
May the ocean of your wishes be completely fulfilled!
Grant us the ocean of siddhis!
Carry out every one of your ocean of activities!
