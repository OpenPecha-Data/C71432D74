The Noble Essence of Dependent Origination
from the Words of the Buddha
In the language of India: Ārya-pratītyasamutpāda-hṛdaya-nāma
In the language of Tibet: 'phags pa rten cing 'brel par 'byung ba'i snying po
In the English language: The Essence of Dependent Origination 
Homage to the Buddha, the Blessed One!
All phenomena that originate from causes,
The Tathāgata has taught these causes,
And also that which puts a stop to these causes,
This too has been taught by the Great Śramaṇa. 
ye dharmā hetu prabhavā hetun teṣāṃ tathāgato hy avadat
teṣāṃ ca yo nirodha evaṃ vādī mahāśramaṇaḥ 
Reciting this essence once will purify all misdeeds and pacify and avert all forms of adversity. An object that is focused upon while reciting this will become a form of the buddha or a support of veneration. An offering that is focused upon while reciting this will become the equivalent of a gift that fills the entire world. 
This concludes the Essence of Dependent Origination.
