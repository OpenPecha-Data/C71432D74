Prayer to Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo 1
Namo guru ānanda-bhadrāya! 2
All-knowing and wholly virtuous in your activity,
All-seeing and perfect, the buddha who prophesied you,
All-illuminating sun of the tradition of Kunga Nyingpo,
All-conquering Vajradhara, Kunzang Dorje, to you I pray. 3
With unimpeded access to a treasury of oceanic sūtras and tantras,
You are the Lion of Speech who sees all the infinite objects of knowledge,
The Lord of Compassion, who holds a white lotus in his hand,
And the Vajra-Wielding Keeper of Secrets—to you I pray. 4
With inexhaustible intelligence, free from delusion’s stain,
You constantly voiced the melody of Mahāyāna Dharma
And drew forth a great river of the four classes of tantra—
To the bringer of ripening and liberation to the fortunate, I pray.
To the one who brought maturity through the four empowerments,
The foundational maṇḍala of Virūpa’s essential instructions, in particular,
And established all at the supreme level of the four kāyas—
Guru Hevajra, to you I pray.
Within the mansion of exalted discipline and renunciation,
You are the noble one whose view and conduct are utterly pure,
Lord Ngorchen, Śākyamuni’s representative in the North—
With great, unshakeable devotion, I pray to you.
As soon as we fortunate ones are touched by the crystalline moon-rays
Of the compassionate blessings of this glorious guru,
May the jasmine flower of our longevity and intelligence bloom,
And may we be protected from all forms of adversity and decline.
From this moment on and throughout all our lives to come,
May we find the freedoms and advantages, purely maintain the three sets of vows,
And spontaneously accomplish a vast ocean of benefit for both ourselves and others,
And all be auspicious for the teachings to flourish throughout the ten directions!
