Prayer from the Vima Nyingtik
Essence of the buddhas, of past, present and future, embodiment of the four kāyas, glorious precious lama, to you I pray, from the depths of my heart:
Grant your blessings, so I may receive all the empowerments;
Grant your blessings, so the extraordinary realization of the profound path may be born in me;
Grant your blessings, so I may realize the view of the natural state, of primordial purity;
Grant your blessings, so I may perfect the wisdom of the four visions of spontaneous presence.
