Direct Instruction
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Considering the extent of the teachings handed down from the gurus of the past, there is no need to add anything new.
Yet simply to avoid turning down your request, the direct instruction is as follows: 
I pay homage at the feet of the guru,
And here present the essence of key points
From the clear light vajra pinnacle:[1] 
Having laid a foundation with the path of devotion,
And severed the basis of the deluded mind at its source,
Naturally and without contrivance,
Sustain clear and empty awareness,
Which is inexpressible and without basis or origin.
When you know the key point of how to
Naturally release dualistic thoughts, they will no longer bind you. 
For enhancement, focus on the merging
Of the outer and inner skies.
Settle without clinging in all-pervasiveness. 
Cultivate renunciation, compassion and bodhicitta,
And strive to adopt and avoid actions according to their effects—this is crucial. 
The one called Chökyi Lodrö
Offered these few words of instruction.
