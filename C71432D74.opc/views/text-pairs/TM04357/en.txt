A Supplication to Realize the Profound
Namo guru!
You cause a pleasant rain of accomplishment and blessings to fall
From the clouds of compassion gathered in the sky-like dharmadhātu,
Lake-born Vajra, Khyentse Wangpo:
I supplicate you from the very depths of my heart.
As the successor of all the vidyādharas and siddhas,
You are a bodhisattva who has perfected the wisdom
Of the clear light heart-essence of Samantabhadra;
Glorious Guru, please bless me to realize this myself!
My mind has never been born — this is the nature of awareness.
To settle in this experience without the slightest alteration or contrivance is meditation;
And conduct is to be without effort or concern for what to do or to avoid —
May I actualize the primordially pure dharmakāya!
