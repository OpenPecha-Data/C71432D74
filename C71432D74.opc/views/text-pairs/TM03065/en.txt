Song Composed for Venerable Jinpa[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Namo guru!
To primordially pure mind-as-such, Samantabhadra’s dharmakāya expanse,
Which is and always has been beyond union and separation, I pray:
Inspire me to realize the perfect ground, beyond transference or change,
And to make manifest primordial liberation. 
To the great, primordially perfect and spontaneously present character,
The nature of radiant clarity, unceasing sambhogakāya, I pray:
Inspire me to reach the full measure of realization
Of clear light that is present uninterruptedly throughout the three times. 
To the nirmāṇakāya of rigpa’s radiance, its play of cognitive potency,
The great liberation upon arising of all that manifests, I pray:
Grant me the assurance whereby saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are naturally freed
And the realization of nirmāṇakāya is made manifest just as it is. 
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö composed this in response to a request from the venerable Jinpa, which was supported by the gift of an auspicious silken scarf and some silver.
