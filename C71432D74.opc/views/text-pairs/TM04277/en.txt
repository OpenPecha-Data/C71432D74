Praise to Sakya Paṇḍita
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti!
Glorious one who overcomes the two obscurations
And spontaneously fulfils the two aims—Gentle Voice,
Source of splendour and most splendid of all,
Mañjughoṣa guru, to you I offer homage. 
Light rays of universal joy, delightful to behold,
You raise the banner of victory for the Sage’s teachings,
And possess the wisdom of perfect knowledge and love,
Excellent one, at your feet I pay homage. 
Mañjughoṣa, may the sweet nectar
From your compassion’s lunar light,
Cause the lily petals of my intellect to open,
And may you dwell within the lotus at my heart. 
May the great light from the sun of your three secrets
Dispel the delusion hidden deep within my heart,
And the sharp blade of your realization of selflessness,
Tear through the entangled web of my view of self. 
Help me to imbibe with insight and diligence
The vast ocean of the Victorious One’s words,
And help me to realize precisely and unerringly
Their genuine definitive meaning and essential points. 
Throughout the entire series of my lives to come,
May you, Mañjughoṣa guru, always care for me.
Never omit me from your compassionate embrace,
But protect me from the ills of existence and peace. 
Thus, the youthful Dharmamati prayed with intense faith and devotion. Siddhi bhavatu! Maṅgalam.
