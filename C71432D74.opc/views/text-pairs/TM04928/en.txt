Song that Arose Spontaneously at Taktse Podrang, Sikkim
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Ahoye!
From the expanse of the unarisen ground,
The path is unobstructed—if you travel it
You will attain the fruition that is unarisen. 
Descendents of the crazy Lhatsün,
On the plain of ālaya inactivity
Is the stallion of naturally cognizant awareness.
By riding this steed with its limbs of wisdom,
You'll cross the plains of existence and peace
And travel to the vast kingdom of dharmakāya,
Wherein to view the spectacle. 
On the 29th day of the later ninth month, this came to mind spontaneously at the Taktse Podrang in Sikkim.[1]

Although the text does not provide the year, it must have been the Fire Monkey (1956) as this is the only year during Jamyang Khyentse's time in Sikkim that the ninth month was repeated. The 29th day of the second ninth month corresponds to 1 December 1956.  ↩
