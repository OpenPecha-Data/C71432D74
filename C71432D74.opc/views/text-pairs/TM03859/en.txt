Maṇḍala Offering That Opens the Door to the Pure Realms
A third-order universe of a hundred times ten million worlds,
With Mount Meru, the four continents and subcontinents adorned with riches—
This realm that fills the entire surface of the earth, I offer.
May all beings enjoy the nirmāṇakāya field!
The unsurpassed realm of great bliss, Drumbeat of Brahmā,
Adorned with Samantabhadra’s offering clouds and goddesses of sensory delight—
This realm that fills the entire region of the sky, I offer.
May all beings enjoy the sambhogakāya field!
The realm of the Vajra Essence, Spontaneously Present Luminosity,
Pervaded by five-coloured light and adorned with kāyas and tiklés—
This realm that fills the whole expanse of space, I offer.
May all beings enjoy the dharmakāya field!
