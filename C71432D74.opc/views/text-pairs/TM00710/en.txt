Guru Yoga
A! My own rigpa, unaltered, is and always has been Vajrasattva,
Spontaneously perfect; above my head is the embodiment of all the buddha families,
Mañjughoṣa in person: the great Chökyi Lodrö, 1
Wisdom treasury of all the buddhas' knowledge and love.
At this master's forehead is Jñāna Vajra—Jikdral Yeshe Dorje, 2
At his throat is Āyudharma—Tsering Chödrön 3 —the lake-arisen Sarasvatī,
At his heart is Dorje Ziji Tsal—Khyentse Wangpo—blazing in splendour,
And at his navel is Maṅgala—Tashi Paljor 4 —his enlightened activity.
Rigpa’s radiance arises as devotion which accomplishes the great purity (of perception),
With that I pray: grant me empowerments, blessings and siddhis!
Recognizing and remembering that my own rigpa is the Lama—
Through this blessing, may your mind and mine merge as one!
