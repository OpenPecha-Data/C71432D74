The Brief Tsok Feast Offering Prayer from 'The Profound Path of the Ḍākinīs' Heart Drop'
raṃ yaṃ khaṃ | oṃ āḥ hūṃ
In the skull of all-pervading space, the torma feast of rigpa is arranged,
The sensual stimulants shine and sparkle as the rainbow rays and tiklé of the six lights;
This wondrous samaya, beyond all imagining,
To all the gurus, devas and ḍākinīs, who are my very own rigpa,
I offer from within the non-dual state of equanimity.
All the limitations of conceptual thought I confess in the great tiklé,
Subject and object, the enemies who obstruct, are liberated into unborn space,
The activity of awakening delusory appearances into original awareness is accomplished.
Having reached the ultimate wisdom of the four visions of spontaneous perfection,
May I attain enlightenment in the youthful vase body of primordial purity!
