Advice for Jamyang Losal[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Aho!
Son, all phenomena are mental projections.
Sickness, pain and pleasure are concepts. 
When you thoroughly investigate conceptual thought,
You find that it’s beyond arising, abiding and ceasing, and neither comes nor goes. 
The mind-as-such, in which clarity, awareness and emptiness
Are indivisibly united, is the guru and the yidam. 
Within the view that recognizes precisely this
Do not be bound by the fetters of grasping.
Out of an experience of this view beyond conceptual elaboration,
Apply yourself to the meditation in which whatever arises – 
Generation, perfection, and so on – is its unobstructed expression. 
The king of all forms of obstacle-removal and enhancement
Is the profound path of guru yoga.
It is vital, therefore, that you focus upon it with devotion. 
This I impart to my heart-son Khen Rinpoche Jamyang Losal.
