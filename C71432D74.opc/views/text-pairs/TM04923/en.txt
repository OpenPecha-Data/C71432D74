The Song of the Vajra
Without birth and so without cease,
Not coming or going, but filling all,
Blissful dharma sublime and unmoving,
Sky-like, freed and without stain,
Rootless, and also without support,
Homeless, unattached, a dharma profound,
Ever free, ever vast, equality effortless,
Subject to neither bondage nor liberation,
An ever present palace encompassing all,
Beyond the equivalence of logic and reason.
So vast, so grand, the space of the sky!
Blazing dharma, the core of the sun and the moon,
Instant presence, now it’s so plain to see,
A mountain of vajra, a lotus so immense
The sun, a lion, this wisdom song.
A sound so great, a music beyond compare,
A pleasure reaching to the ends of space,
A buddha equal to all of the buddhas,
Samantabhadra the vast, the peak of the dharma,
In the womb of Samantabhadrī, her sky-like space,
Open clarity, instantly present—the ever great perfection!
