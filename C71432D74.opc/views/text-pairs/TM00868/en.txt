Billowing Clouds of Faith: A Prayer
The blessings of the Mañjughoṣa Guru entered your heart,
Dharma nectar caused the lotus of intelligence to bloom,
And you raised the victory banner of nonsectarian teachings—
From the depths of my heart, I pray to you: inspire me with your blessings.
You gained critical the strength of insight into the textual tradition
And loudly proclaimed the vajra laughter of scripture and reasoning.
To you, the illuminator of the teachings of Kinsman of the Sun, 1
I pray from the depths of my heart: inspire me with your blessings.
Mighty lord of speech, whose great strength of heart
Is like that of valiant Mañjuśrī and who, with a leonine roar
Of fine explanation, vanquishes the beasts of erroneous views,
May you remain forever indestructible as the seven vajra properties.
