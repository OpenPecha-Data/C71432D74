Lords of the Three Families Thangka Inscription[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti!
Through creating this image
Of the vajra-bearing keeper of all the victors’ secret treasury,[2]
Mañjuśrīghoṣa and the holder of the White Lotus,[3]
May Kunga Trinlé’s misdeeds be purified,
And may the door to realms of duḥkha be forever closed. 
May he be reborn miraculously in a realm such as
Aṭakāvatī[4] or Sukhāvatī,
And there behold the face of the victorious one.
May he gain the freedoms and advantages in a pure location,
And be rich with the splendours of longevity, Dharma and merit. 
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö offered these verses of aspiration as a recto inscription. May this be a cause for the one who is the object of focus to purify misdeeds and obscurations, escape states that lack freedom, and obtain a pure physical support that is rich with the treasure of virtuous qualities.
