Entrusting Activity to the Dharmapālas
Cause the teachings of the victorious Lion of the Śākyas
And sūtras and mantras introduced through the aspirations and efforts
Of the Abbot, Master and Dharma-King, as well as the hosts
Of emanated translators and scholars of Old and New traditions
To flourish and spread through teaching and through practice.
Dispel the darkness of errancy in those obscured by their mistaken views
And envy towards the wholly and naturally pure teachings,
Who deserve to be tamed by peaceful means;
Inspire them with confidence in the Dharma that is profound and vast.
Cause those who are ensnared by the demon of extremism,
Enemies of the teachings, who are zealously disdainful,
To be liberated by the weapons of the Great Blazing One
And then proffered to the mouths of the Fearsome.
Cause the power and influence of those who disparage the teachings
And who plunder beings’ happiness and glories,
The barbarian hordes within and without,
To diminish just like flowers ravaged by frost.
Cause those with faith and devotion for the Victor’s precious teachings,
Who possess noble and altruistic intentions,
To enjoy long lives, good health, and abundant happiness,
And have all their wishes fulfilled.
Cause those who hold the torch and raise the banner of the Sage’s teachings,
Bodhisattvas who cause the great drum of Dharma to resound,
Since they are of such fundamental importance to the teachings,
To lead long lives without any deterioration of their vitality.
For us yogins and yoginīs who uphold the samaya commitments,
May enemies, demons, obstacles, curses, sorcery,
Or harm brought about by disease or epidemics
Be swiftly pacified and all our wishes spontaneously fulfilled.
In short, let the ocean of oath-bound guardians of the teachings
Recall the solemn pledges that they made in the past,
Intensify the power of their forceful activity,
And cause the Buddha’s teachings to flourish and spread.
Accompany us as inseparably as the body’s shadow,
Clearly reveal the good and bad to be adopted and avoided,
Banish all adversity, bring about favourable circumstances,
And carry out the activity that is victorious over all.
