The Rain of Wisdom Blessings A Song of Prayer to the Guru
Aho!
Amidst an expanse of self-arisen, five-coloured rainbow light, 1
My only father, gracious guru, Chökyi Lodrö, watch over me!
Do not allow us, whose karma is so wicked, to fall prey to delusion
But inspire us with the determination to escape conditioned existence!
Great treasure of altruism and compassion, heir to the victorious, watch over me!
Inspire me to subjugate this demon of self-clinging,
Master the sublime bodhicitta of cherishing others above myself,
And become a source of benefit for beings throughout the whole of space.
Vajra vidyādhara, representative of Padmākara,
Yeshe Dorje Ösal Nyingpo Tsal, watch over me!
Confer the stream of four empowerments on my three doors,
And bless me with maturation as the four vajras!
Jigme Namkhai Dorje in your wisdom form,
Vima’s emanation, Tsewang Drubpa Tsal, watch over me!
Inspire me with your blessings, so that dualistic thoughts may dissolve into the space of dharmatā,
And I may reach the culmination of the four visions of clear light!
From this moment on, until I reach the essence of enlightenment,
Inspire me with your blessings, O glorious guru, protector, lord of Dharma, so that I may be reborn in your presence,
Receive the essence of your wisdom mind, perfect the practice,
And empty the three realms from their very depths!
