A Prayer to the Svayambhū Stūpa 1 in Nepal
Emaho!
This great spontaneously arisen stūpa of the dharmakāya,
Infused with the blessings of the buddhas’ wisdom minds,
To this place, renowned as the “Vajra Peak”, 2
So wondrous as to defy the imagination, I pray!
In the earthly town of Śāntipur
Lies the emanated maṇḍala of the Heruka,
The great rūpakāya stūpa of Svayambhū,
To the Gomasālagandha, 3 I pray!
The Buddhas of past, present and future all set foot here,
And it's filled with the jewel-like relics of the buddhas of the seven ages—
To this great stūpa, in devotion,
I pay homage and offer constant prayer!
I confess my harmful actions, rejoice in virtue, request the turning of the Dharma wheel,
Implore the buddhas to remain, and dedicate my merits to living beings—
May they all arrive at the sublime attainment of the three kāyas!
Through the power of this supreme representation, may happiness reign throughout the whole world,
May the teachings of the Omniscient Buddha flourish and spread,
May all harm to the teachings be pacified,
And may all be auspicious for positive signs of benefit and happiness to spread far and wide!
