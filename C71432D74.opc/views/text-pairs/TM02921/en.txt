Offering to the Five Mentsün Sisters, Guardians of the Earth
Hrīḥ! Five ḍākinīs who arise simultaneously with the great Mother of Space,
Manifesting as the five mentsün sisters, guardians of the earth,
Together with your retinue of hundreds of thousands of ḍākinīs:
We supplicate you! We make this offering to you! Carry out the activities we request of you!
