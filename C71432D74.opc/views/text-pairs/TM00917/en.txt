Prayer to the Supremely Learned Holders of the Glorious Sakya Teachings
Kunga Zangpo, prophesied by the victorious one,
Second buddha, all-knowing Evaṃpa,
Standing tall among oceanic bodhisattvas,
Ngorchen Dorje Chang, to you I pray. 1
Lord Dzongpa, vital pillar of the teachings of the whispered transmission,
Which came down from the exalted Dorje Chang,
Tutop Wangchuk Kunga Namgyal, 2
Great lord of yogis, to you I pray.
You perfectly mastered the myriad texts of the scriptural collections,
And constantly beheld the smiling countenance of the protector Ajita, 3
Realizing the intent of the Great Vehicle, profound and vast—
Omniscient Sangye Pal, to you I pray. 4
Through your diligent study and critical intellect, you gathered
An ocean of knowledge related to sūtra and mantra within your vase-like mind,
And were unrivalled in explanation, debate and composition—
Rongtön Mawé Sengé, to you I pray. 5
You elucidated precisely and without error
The essential point of the invincible Mañjughoṣa’s realization,
And spread the study and practice of oceanic mantra lineages in all directions—
Omniscient Sonam Senge, to you I pray. 6
Preeminent among the myriad proponents of the five sciences,
You spread the tradition of the definitive essence,
Great paṇḍita Śākya Chokden Drakpé Pal, 7
Great crown adornment of the learned, to you I pray.
Through the power of supplicating these sublime ones,
May all obstacles to our attainment of awakening in this life be pacified,
And in future lives may we go wherever these supreme guides reside
And savour the nectar of their enlightened speech.
