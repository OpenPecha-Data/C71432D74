Aspiration to Be Chanted at the Conclusion of the Recitation
Having first set your mind upon supreme awakening,
You became enlightened, a guide to beings, just as your aspired.
In devotion, I bow before the gurus, victors and their heirs:
Grant your blessings, that my own aspirations may be fulfilled.
Through the virtue that we yogis, the teacher and students,
Have accumulated through our recitation of the Maṇi, 1
And the force of virtue amassed throughout the three times,
May all the wishes of the gracious guru be fulfilled.
May our kind parents, who gave us life and physical form,
Our kind dharma friends, monks, students and patrons,
And all the kind animals we’ve ridden, burdened, and milked
Swiftly attain complete and perfect enlightenment.
May all the beings whose flesh we’ve eaten and whose hides we’ve worn,
Whom we’ve beaten with sticks and stones and killed with weapons,
Whom we’ve poisoned, forcibly slaughtered, and trampled upon,
Swiftly attain the level of perfect enlightenment.
May all sentient beings, my very own mothers,
Equal in number to the vastness of space itself,
Complete the accumulations, purify obscurations and attain enlightenment.
May these prayers of aspiration swiftly be fulfilled.
