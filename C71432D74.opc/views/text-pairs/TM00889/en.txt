Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Namo guru!
The actual embodiment of all the victorious buddhas of the three times
And sole refuge for the teachings and beings of this degenerate age was Khyentse Wangpo.
Manifestation of his supreme blessings and compassion,
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, to you I pray!
Cause my own and other beings’ minds to turn towards the Dharma,
And inspire me to encounter my own true face, the natural state!
Unstained by any objects perceived as external,
And unspoilt by any inner perceiving thoughts—
Sustaining an uncontrived experience of settled meditation,
May the dharmatā condition of my own mind nakedly arise!
This is the wisdom intent of all the buddhas.
Through the profound practice of decisive contentment,
Inspire me to realize the three kāyas of my own awareness
And to empty saṃsāra from its very depths!
