A Song in Six Verses
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Ah Eh!
All-knowing perfect buddha,
Remain forever inseparably
In your place upon my crown. 
Transmit the blessings of the direct transmission,
Confer the empowerment of the force of awareness,
Bring me to the state at which delusion is exhausted,
Cause my perception to unfold without aim or focus. 
All dharmas of appearance and existence are illusory
And lack true nature or reality;
All dharmas have been pure from the very beginning. 
Great self-knowing awareness beyond the mind,
A state free from deliberate activity or exertion,
Magnificent luminosity and equalness—
In this expanse of the all-encompassing sphere
There is great, spontaneous perfection—Aho! 
Seeing does not come about through looking,
But great settling, spontaneous and uncontrived,
In the womb that is threefold leaving-as-is,
Where the three kāyas are naturally present,
Without rejection or adoption, removal or addition. 
By seeing this through the guru’s kindness,
May all sentient beings of the three realms
Attain complete and perfect awakening
Within the youthful vase body of their own awareness. 
Written by Kunzang Ösel Nyingpo.
