Grant your blessings, so that the rains may always fall on time.
Grant your blessings, so that harvests may always be bountiful and livestock always prosper.
Grant your blessings, so that disease among human beings and livestock may be pacified.
Grant your blessings, so that the conflicts and famines of this age may be no more.
Grant your blessings, so that enemies, bandits, and robbers may be subdued.
Grant your blessings, so that there may be an end to frost, hail and drought.
Grant your blessings, so that there happiness and well-being may reign throughout the land!
