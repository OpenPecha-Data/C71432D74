Entranceway for the Faithful Refuge and Bodhicitta Prayers Taking Refuge Generating Bodhicitta Prayer
In the guru, who is all the buddhas in person,
Three Jewels, the unfailing, constant refuge,
And the yidams, ḍākinīs and dharmapālas,
I and all other beings devotedly take refuge.
I vow to attain Buddhahood for the sake of all.
Therefore, I practice sublime, sacred Dharma.
I resolve that having swiftly gained awakening,
I shall liberate all beings, infinite in number.
To the root and lineage gurus, peaceful and wrathful yidams,
Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions and three times,
Vīras, ḍākinīs and dharmapālas of the three abodes,
I offer heartfelt prayers: inspire me with your blessings!
