A Brief Prayer to the Precious Master Padmākara for Swiftly Fulfilling Wishes
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
Embodiment of all sources of refuge, Orgyen Rinpoche,
To you we pray, with a yearning so strong it is hard to bear.
Dispel all obstacles, outer, inner and secret, into space
And grant your blessing so all our aims and wishes are fulfilled, according to the Dharma.
