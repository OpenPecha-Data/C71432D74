Prayer for Ngawang Lobzang 1
Glorious guru, lord of all the buddha families,
Unique embodiment of all the victors’ wisdom,
Master of knowledge and love, 2 Chökyi Lodrö,
Guide and care for me until I reach awakening.
I pray to you with ardent faith and devotion,
Rely on you alone with unwavering confidence and trust.
Inspire me with your blessings throughout all my lives to come. 3
Never let me slip from your compassionate embrace.
Inspire me to develop the determination to escape conditioned existence,
To make pure ethical discipline the basis of attaining supreme liberation,
To train my mind and master supreme bodhicitta,
And to realize the profound nature of reality.
