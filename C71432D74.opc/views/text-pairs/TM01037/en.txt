The Offering-Clouds of Samantabhadra A Concise Confession and Fulfilment Practice of the Three Roots
Hūṃ Hrīḥ. The perfectly pure environment and inhabitants are the great Vajra Akaniṣṭha,
In which, through these gifts, both actually arranged and created by the mind—
Outer, inner, secret and unsurpassable offerings of suchness,
Amassed as a vast ocean of offering-clouds like those emanated by Samantabhadra—
May the noble intentions of the vidyādharas, the root and lineage gurus, be fulfilled!
May the noble intentions of the peaceful and wrathful yidam deities be fulfilled!
May the noble intentions of the vīras and ḍākinīs of the three abodes be fulfilled!
May the noble intentions of the ocean of dharma protectors and wealth deities be fulfilled!
May all be fulfilled as the great infinite purity of appearance and existence.
As we thus fulfil your noble intentions and confess our impairments and breakages,
Grant us the attainment of unobscured purity,
And carry out supreme and ordinary activities just as we desire!
