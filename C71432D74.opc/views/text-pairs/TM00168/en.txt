The Vajra Sitar of Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of the Fourth Incarnation of Terchen Chokgyur Lingpa
Oṃ svasti!
Padmasambhava—forefather of hundreds of accomplished vidyādharas —
Yidam deities—magical manifestations of unchanging great bliss—
And the assembly of vajra dharma-protectors and ḍākinīs,
Through your wondrous truth, may all be powerfully auspicious!
Custodian of the liberating instructions and ripening empowerments
Of the Supreme Vehicle, the Kama and Terma of the Ancient Translations,
Lord of scholars and sages—like the full moon rising bright above,
May your life, awakened vision and activity reign victorious over all!
May the tradition of the Great Tertön, the King of Dharma,
Holder of the seven special transmissions,
Remain until the end of time, like a celebration from the Golden Age—
The three worlds forever adorned by this auspicious flower of wondrous goodness!
