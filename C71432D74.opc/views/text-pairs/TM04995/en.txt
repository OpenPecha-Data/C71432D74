Concise Feast Offering for the Spontaneous Fulfillment of Wishes
namo guru-mahā-nidhibhyaḥ
Oṃ āh hūṃ
Gurus, vidyādharas, Three Roots, and deities of the maṇḍala,
Come here and joyfully partake of this feast offering!
We confess our transgressions, and offer the flesh and blood
Of liberated enemies and obstructers. May the remainders be enjoyed by the recipients!
Pacify outer, inner, and secret obstacles
And spontaneously fulfill all wishes!
