Prayer to Lekpa Rinpoche
Illusory manifestation of the wisdom of the victors of past, present and future,
Mighty tamer of demonic forces, Vajra Mahākāla,
Appearing here and now as my sole protector, Lord of Dharma—
Ngawang Lekpa, at your feet I pray.
May any thought that conceives of some fault
In the lifestyle or activity of the noble guru never arise.
May I see whatever he does in a positive light, and
Through such devotion, may his blessings infuse my mind.
Through the power and blessings of the gurus, Three Jewels and deities,
And the mighty strength of an ocean of oath-bound dharma guardians,
May the life of this glorious protector guru remain secure,
And may his enlightened activity flourish and spread.
