Four Pieces of Advice
by Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa

Do not disturb the guru’s mind; fulfill their every command.
Do not quarrel with vajra siblings; be honest and sincere towards them.
Practice the meditation and recitation of the yidam deity every day, and never fail to make a feast offering on the tenth day of the lunar month.
Maintain the practice of trekchö, and do not take the life of any sentient beings.

These are the four qualities that all contemporary tantric practitioners should have. One who upholds these is the best kind of tantric practitioner in this present age.
