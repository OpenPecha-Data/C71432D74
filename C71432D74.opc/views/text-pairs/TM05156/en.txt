The Quintessence of the Ārya Mañjuśrī Tantra
Homage to Mañjuśrī, the youthful!
In this way, to the Awakened One, the transcendent Lord,
The wisdom kāya, spontaneously arisen,
The single eye of wisdom, entirely unobscured,
The light of wisdom, forever shining brightly,
To you, Arapacana, I pay homage.
To you, the very embodiment of wisdom, I bow.
Thus it is explained by all the perfect buddhas.
This concludes this teaching, spoken by the transcendent lord Śākyamuni:
the Essence of the Perfect Recitation of the Names of the Wisdom Being, the Transcendent Lord Mañjuśrī.
