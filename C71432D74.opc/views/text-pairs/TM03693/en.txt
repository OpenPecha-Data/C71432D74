True Words of Gathering Auspiciousness: A Long-Life Prayer
Namo guru!
Through the power and truth of the victors and their heirs
Throughout the ten directions and four times, the Three Roots and guardians of the Dharma,
May the full force of their true blessings be brought to bear, so that this, the object of our aspiration
May be fulfilled without impediment.
Supreme play of the magical net of wisdom
Of the Mañjughoṣa guru Khyentse Wangpo,
Maintaining the full force of his powerful activity—
Chökyi Lodrö, may your lotus feet remain secure.
Through the blessings of the awesome Vajrakumāra,
May any obstacles to the glorious guru’s life be eliminated,
May he raise aloft the victory banner of teaching and practice,
And while he lives for a hundred aeons, 1 may his enlightened activity spread far and wide.
