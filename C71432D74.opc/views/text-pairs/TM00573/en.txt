Brief Advice[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Having paid homage at the feet of the guru,
Contemplate the difficulty of gaining the freedoms and advantages,
And then reflect on death.
Understand that no matter where one is born
Throughout existence, there is only suffering,
And never the chance of real happiness,
And develop an attitude of determination to be free.
Since actions inevitably bear fruit,
Adopt virtue and avoid misdeeds.
Develop stable, irreversible trust
In the unfailing sources of refuge,
The guru and the Three Jewels.
Recognizing all beings as one’s parents,
Cultivate love, compassion and bodhicitta.
Strive to gather the accumulations and purify obscurations
As this will bring effortless blessings and wisdom.
Devotion for the guru is crucially important.
Always meditate on the profound two stages.
Exert yourself in river-like recitation.
And, above all, always sustain
The nature of mind with unwavering attention.
Dedicate all virtue for the sake of beings.
Practising this way will prove significant. 
By Chökyi Lodrö.
