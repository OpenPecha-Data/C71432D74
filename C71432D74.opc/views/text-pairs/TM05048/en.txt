The Outer, Inner and Secret Refuge Practice of the Mahāsiddha Thangtong Gyalpo
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the precious buddha.
In the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, we take refuge.
In the assembly of gurus, yidam deities and ḍākinīs, we take refuge.
In the dharmakāya, the inseparable emptiness and clarity of our own minds, we take refuge.
