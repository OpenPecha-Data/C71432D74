Three-Name Prayer to Chokgyur Lingpa 1
Regent of the Lotus Born, Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa,
Sovereign of the teachings of kama and terma , Dechen Lingpa,
Master of unbiased, natural great perfection, Zhikpo Lingpa,
One treasure-revealer known by three names of Lingpa!
I pray to you, the one whose kindness is threefold:
May true renunciation awaken naturally in my mind;
May I keep the samaya commitments to the glorious guru;
May I quickly show signs of success in generation and perfection;
May I actualize the great perfection of my own awareness,
And in a single lifetime attain the state of Buddhahood!
