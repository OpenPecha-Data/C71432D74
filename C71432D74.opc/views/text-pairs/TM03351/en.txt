Guru Yoga 1
In the sky before me, upon a white lotus and moon,
Is my own root guru, all-seeing Mañjughoṣa,
Chökyi Lodrö, white with a reddish glow,
His two hands in the gesture of Resting in Mind’s Nature,
And his two legs crossed in the vajra posture.
To this great embodiment of all sources of refuge,
I present my body and possessions as the offering clouds of Samantabhadra.
With acute sorrow and remorse, 2 I confess my misdeeds, obscurations, faults and downfalls
Accumulated throughout all my lives in saṃsāra without beginning.
As I pray to you with ardent faith and intense devotion,
Look upon me with compassion in this and future lives and in the bardo state.
Prevent me from suffering the torment of a painful death,
O protector, but care for and guide me along the path to liberation.
And bless me with rebirth in a supreme realm of purity.
Finally the guru merges with me inseparably,
And all sights and sounds arise as the guru’s display.
In all my lives, may I never be separated from the perfect lama,
And having benefited fully from the splendour of the Dharma,
May I perfect the qualities of the paths and bhūmis,
And swiftly attain the sublime level of Vajradhara!
