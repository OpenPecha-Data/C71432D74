Eliminator of Suffering A Prayer to the Venerable and Exalted Tārā
Only mother of all the buddhas of the three times,
Venerable Tārā, goddess who is swift and gallant,
Respectfully I pay homage at the blue lotus beneath your feet:
Clear away the torment that afflicts me physically and mentally, I pray.
In your sublime form you embody the activity
Of all the buddhas and the bodhisattvas.
Noble Tārā, as soon as I recall your splendid face,
Eliminate all the miseries of existence, I pray.
When unbearable forces arise like monsters
Out of the turbulent sea of sixteenfold danger,
As I chant your name and call out to you,
Grant me protection there and then, I pray.
When my longevity, wisdom, merit and funds are depleted,
In contrast to the universal fortune and virtue I seek,
Then, by calling out to you in heartfelt prayer,
Cause them to increase like the waxing moon, I pray.
Make my ethical discipline pure, my study, reflection and meditation grow,
Let my qualities of wisdom, capacity and love reach their full potential,
And make me inseparable from you, the venerable goddess
Who acts with the full force of all the victorious ones, I pray.
Grant me perfect victory in the battle against untimely death,
Set firm the pillar of an indestructible and immortal vital force,
Let the nectar of accomplishment invigorate my body and mind,
And let me realize the essence of the Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, I pray.
Cause the Buddha’s non-sectarian teachings to flourish and spread,
Show your frown of wrath and subdue all who harm the teachings,
Increase the power and influence of Dharma patrons,
And usher in the golden dawn of a new and perfect age.
In short, in joy as in sorrow, no matter what befalls me,
May you, O venerable and blessed goddess,
Never part from me even for a single instant,
And cause all my wishes to be effortlessly fulfilled.
