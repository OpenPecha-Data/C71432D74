Amṛta Offering For The Guru’s Heart-Practice, Wish-Fulfilling Jewel
To the deathless dharmakāya, 1 ablaze with thousands of luminous marks;
To the all-illuminating sambhogakāya 2 possessed of the five certainties;
And to the great-bliss nirmāṇakāya, Guru of Uḍḍiyāna—
I present this offering of amṛta: bestow the empowerments and siddhis!
To venerable Tsogyel, only mother who cares for the people of Tibet;
To King Tri Song, gentle protector of unmatched kindness;
And to Yeshé Rölpa Tsel, heart son of the Guru—
I present this offering of amṛta: bestow the empowerments and siddhis!
To Dorjé Ziji Tsel, 3 universal lord of all buddha families;
To Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa, great treasure-revealing guru;
And to Pema Garwang, 4 protector of the maṇḍala—
I present this offering of amṛta: bestow the empowerments and siddhis!
To all the Dharma custodians, the succession of lineage holders—
Treasuries of ripening and liberating amṛta whose aspirations and karma are ripe;
Eminent beacons of the doctrine foretold in the oral transmissions—
I present this offering of amṛta: bestow the empowerments and siddhis!
To the myriad deities of the Three Roots, and all the guardians—
Members of the maṇḍala of the Guru, the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel,
The Lotus-Born Vajradhara, sole refuge in these degenerate times—
I present this offering of amṛta: bestow the empowerments and siddhis!
