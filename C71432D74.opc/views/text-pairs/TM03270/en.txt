A Yearning Plea to the Precious Guru
Emaho: O wonder!
All buddhas of past, present and future in person—Padmākara,
Master from whom the infinite gurus, devas and ḍākinīs arise,
Only refuge for the teachings and for beings in the land of snows,
To you, the Precious Guru of Orgyen, we pray!
Dispel all obstacles; fulfil our aspirations every one, just as we desire;
Fill us with the inspiration and blessing of your vajra body, speech and mind;
Make the great radiance of rigpa arise within us in experience and realization;
Grant us the siddhis, ordinary and supreme!
In all our lives, may you, ‘The Lake-born Vajra’,
Be the lord of our enlightened family, and,
Through receiving the nectar of your secret speech, let us be infused with the vision of your wisdom mind
So that we can serve and work for your teachings, O Guru!
Pacify all the dark hordes of asuras and barbarians,
Let the teaching and its holders increase and spread!
In the land of Tibet let bliss, happiness and auspiciousness arise,
Inspire us with your blessing, to accomplish the well-being of ourselves and others!
