The Swift Path to Great Bliss A Sādhana of Amitābha, Buddha of Limitless Light
While experiencing the emptiness nature of all phenomena,
I meditate on all-pervasive loving compassion.
Within that state of emptiness and compassion
All that appears and exists is the pure realm of great bliss. In its centre,
Upon a lotus and moon disc seat, my own awareness is the syllable HRĪḤ.
From it light radiates out, accomplishing the twofold benefit―for myself and others.
I am transformed into the Bhagavan, the transcendent accomplished conqueror,
Amitābha, Buddha of Limitless Light, red in colour,
With one face and two hands, resting in the mudrā of equanimity,
Holding an almsbowl filled with nectar.
His two legs are in the posture of immutability.
His enlightened body wears the three dharma robes.
With major and minor marks, he is utterly perfect,
Supreme embodiment of the buddhas' five kāyas,
Appearing yet devoid of inherent nature.
At his heart, upon a moon disc, is a red syllable HRĪḤ,
Encircled by the mantra in a clockwise direction,
Radiating light. All the sugatas, just as visualized,
Are invited and dissolve into the visualization.
jaḥ hūṃ baṃ hoḥ
Light radiates from the mantra, bringing twofold benefit―for self and others.
All forms that appear are pure as Amitābha;
All that resounds is in essence the sound of mantra;
All thoughts, all concepts are pure as the five wisdoms.
In the state of great bliss, I recite the mantra:
oṃ amideva ayu siddhi hūṃ hrīḥ
