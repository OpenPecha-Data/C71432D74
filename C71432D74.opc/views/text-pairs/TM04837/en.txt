The Universal Medicine for Healing All Ills
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Homage to the lama! 
Sickness is conceptual thought.
When you are ill, be ill within the dharmatā nature.
Within the nature of things, there is no illness.
Sickness, without reference—let it be released into all-pervading space.
Sickness is an embellishment of dharmatā's display,
And the play of intrinsic reality is unceasing.
All that appears to us is sickness,
All sickness is by nature wisdom.
Within this wisdom, settle undistractedly,
And causes and effects of sickness will be purified into all-pervading space. 
May all living beings throughout the three worlds
Be spontaneously freed from the sickness of destructive emotions! 
When Rabchok was ill, I, the one called Lodrö, composed this in jest. May virtue abound!
