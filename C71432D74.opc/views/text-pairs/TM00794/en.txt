A Prayer to the Stūpa of Jarung Khashor in Boudha
Namo guru!
This great stūpa symbolizing the dharmakāya,
The sublime wisdom mind of all the buddhas,
Shines bright like the sun throughout all the realms of existence and quiescence—
‘Great Liberation Upon Seeing’, to you I pray!
Precious reliquary piled high with sacred relics,
Such as the ringsel of the buddha Mahākāśyapa,
Which arose from the noble aspirations of the ḍākinī Samvarī—
Supreme representation ‘Wish-Fulfilling Jewel’, to you I pray!
The Abbot, the Precious Master and the Dharma King
Made their aspirations here to spread the Buddha’s teachings to the North—
To this field for the accumulation of merit among gods and human beings,
I prostrate in devotion!
Before you, I make offerings, I confess my misdeeds and I rejoice in virtue;
I implore the masters to teach and to remain without passing into parinirvāṇa;
And I dedicate all my merits to the infinity of beings throughout the vast reaches of the universe.
May the Buddhadharma flourish and may the lives of its holders remain secure!
May the turmoil of this age be pacified and may the splendours of happiness and virtue increase!
May everyone—male and female, living or dead—who has any connection with you
Be brought swiftly to supreme and unsurpassable awakening!
