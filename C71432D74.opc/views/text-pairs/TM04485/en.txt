Short Prayer to Shabkar’s Various Incarnations
Countless aeons ago,
You swiftly attained perfect enlightenment,
And in order to benefit beings and the Victorious One’s teachings,
Manifested in various forms, as appropriate, for beings’ sake.
At the time of the Buddha you were Ārya Avalokiteśvara,
In the land of India you were the sublime Mañjuśrīmitra,
In the heart of Tibet you were Drenpa Namkha, 1
In the Kagyü tradition you were Milarepa himself,
During the Kadam era you were the glorious Gyalse Tokme, 2
In the Ganden tradition you were the noble Lodrö Gyaltsen, 3
For followers of nonsectarianism, you manifested as Thangtong Gyalpo.
Now, at the present time, you are Shabkar, protector of beings.
In future, in Abhirati and other pure-lands of the five families,
You will appear as the foremost heir
Of each of the lords of buddha families,
And lead anyone with a connection to their chosen realm.
Throughout the three times of past, present and future,
You display various forms according to what is needed.
Compassionate one, who serves the teachings and beings,
Lord of refuge, wish-fulfilling jewel, to you I pray.
A wish-granting jewel is hard to find even when sought
Through oceans of aeons in billions of realms of the ten directions,
And its discovery is an event of vast significance.
Yet to meet the guru is even greater still, the most excellent fortune!
From now on, throughout all my lives to come,
May I never be separated from you, O protector,
May the nectar of your speech mature and liberate my mind,
And may the twofold benefit of self and other be spontaneously accomplished.
