Single-Verse Auspiciousness Prayer of the Three Long-Life Deities
Empowered by the flowing nectar from the excellent vase that the protector Amitāyus holds,
Triumphant over all adversity through the crossed double-vajra of Uṣṇīṣayavijayā,
And with the sweet, nectarous blessings from the utpala , which Tārā, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, clasps as she grants protection,
Seeping into the hearts of the fortunate, may all be auspicious for the attainment of immortality!
