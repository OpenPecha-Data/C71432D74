Hūṃ! From out of all-pervading space, your compassion unwavering, the Great Lion, Lord Gesar,
You who embody all gurus, devas and ḍākinīs: Jewel Who Subdues Foes,
Together with your assembly of protectors, dralas and wermas ,
Through the force of your compassionate pledge, come now,
And accept these offerings of samaya substances, amṛta and torma ;
Show us real signs of accomplishment,
And fulfil all our hopes and aspirations.
Grant us supreme and ordinary siddhis, we pray!
