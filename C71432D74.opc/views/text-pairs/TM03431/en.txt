Brief Advice for Lama Sherab Puntsok[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti.
May the refuge gurus embrace us with compassion.
I pray that my own and other beings’ minds
May turn towards noble Dharma and liberation. 
Life is as transient as a bubble on water:
For now it is here, and then it is no more.
This is the time to fear the enemy, Yama,
And thus to take up the sacred Dharma. 
For now we have the support, free and well advantaged,
But if we devote ourselves to many meaningless tasks,
Our situation for the remainder of our lives is uncertain.
And at death we’ll cry, "Atsama!" as we bang our chests.
Although we might feel regret, by then it will be too late.
Quickly, quickly, therefore, apply the sacred Dharma. 
I hope that this affectionate advice to you, my friend,
May help you achieve the goal of lasting happiness. 
Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö offered this brief advice to his own student, Lama Sherab Puntsok of Yena Monastery.
