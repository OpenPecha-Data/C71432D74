A Song Requested by the Buddhist Monk Jamyang Yönten Gyatso
Oṃ svasti.
Guru Vajradhara, the embodiment of all sources of refuge,
Chökyi Lodrö, incomparable in your kindness, care for me!
Inspire me to fuse my mindstream with the Dharma!
Help me to realize the view of the union of clarity and emptiness, beyond conceptual elaboration,
To integrate it through the meditation that is undistracted and without fixation,
To maintain utterly pure conduct by means of the three sets of vows,
And to reap the fruits of the four empowerments within this very lifetime!
In short, whatever befalls me, whether happiness or sorrow, circumstances good or bad,
I have no other hope but you – O guru, care for me!
Until I reach awakening, hold me with your compassion without ever parting.
