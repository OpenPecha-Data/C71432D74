Daily Practice of Hayagrīva
Out of Hrīḥ, on a lotus and sun disc,
And a seat of eight folded serpents,
I appear as Hayagrīva, perfect in an instant of recollection.
He is red with three faces and six arms,
The central face red, the right green and left white,
All three featuring horse’s heads at the crown.
He holds vajra, khaṭvāṅga and sword in his right hands,
Makes a threatening mudrā and holds a spear and lasso with his left hands.
His eight legs are in the heroic stance and he wears a tiger-skin skirt.
Dried and fresh skulls and a chain of serpents adorn him,
And he stands amidst a blazing mass of wisdom fire.
At his heart, upon a sun disc, is a clear red Hrīḥ
Surrounded by the mantra garland,
From which light radiates out to destroy all harmful influences and obstacles
And to bring the attainment of blessings and accomplishment.
oṃ hrīḥ padmānta kṛta vajra krodha hayagrīva hulu hulu hūṃ phaṭ
Appearance as the deity dissolves into the space of dharmatā.
Then, once again, I arise in the form of Hayagrīva.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Hayagrīva, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach his state of perfection too.
