Averting Negativity through Siṃhamukhā, the Lion-Faced Ḍākinī
Glorious vajra goddess,
Fierce one with a lion’s face,
Radiating wisdom firelight—
Lion-Faced Goddess, I bow to you!
a ka sa ma ra ca śa da ra sa ma ra ya phaṭ
O Lion-Faced Ḍākinī, through the power and force of reciting your vidyā-mantra, for us practitioners, teachers, students and our families and friends, may all enemies who spite us, obstructors who would harm us, and conditions that hinder us—in short, everything inauspicious and negative—be averted!
Host of ladies ablaze with wrath—
Reduce to dust the body and speech
Of all enemies, obstructers, and curses,
And free their minds into dharmadhātu!
Through the power of our reciting your vidyā-mantra,
Ensure that all harm-doers are pacified,
That everything goes according to our wishes,
And that the study and practice of the teachings thrive!
