Bestowing the Splendour of Immortality A Prayer for the Long Life of Jetsün Kushok Chimey Luding Rinpoche
Oṃ svasti!
Through the blessings of an ocean of deathless long-life deities,
May this foremost of ḍākinīs, from the clan of divine luminosity,
One who bestows the splendour of great bliss and has mastered
The infinite activity of the vidyādharas’ mantras, live long, I pray.
Sovereign of all those who have accomplished immortality,
Sun of the teachings, protector of the teachings and beings,
Born of the Dharma and the venerable Sakya family,
May your activity of twofold benefit continuously increase.
Having set out upon the path of deathlessness and freedom,
Found the good fortune to ripen and liberate one’s own mind,
And directly realize one’s own true face, the actual dharmatā,
May this auspicious benefit and happiness never fade but always remain secure!
