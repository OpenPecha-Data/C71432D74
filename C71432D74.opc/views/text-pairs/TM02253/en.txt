Advice for Jamyang Losal Zangpo[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 
Kyeho!
Son, constantly recall the guru,
And with devotion, as the vital pillar of the path,
Recognise whatever appears as the guru.
Then, the wisdom of realization of the great Sakyapa, your old father,
Will be transferred into your mindstream. 
Visualize your body as the deity,
Integrate your speech into the path through recitation,
And do not let your thoughts and impressions ever stray
Beyond the experience of great primordial wisdom. 
To put it simply, what is the point of excessive talk?
Tame your own mind, blend your being with the Dharma,
And train constantly in the cultivation of the Dharma’s essence,
The two types of bodhicitta, relative and ultimate. 
Thus, Chökyi Lodrö wrote this for the sake of his own student Jamyang Losal Zangpo.[2]
