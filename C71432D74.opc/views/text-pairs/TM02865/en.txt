Prayer for Lobzang Chödzin, Dharma Practitioner of Changra
Svasti!
Glorious one who holds the victory banner of teaching and practice
In the Dharma tradition of the peerless son of Śuddhodana, 1
Dīpaṃkara 2 and the second omniscient one, Lobzang Drakpa— 3
Venerable guru, at your feet I pray.
Supreme, unfailing refuge for all beings, infinite in number,
With noble mind, as the excellent activity of all the victorious ones,
You preside auspiciously over the kingdom of Dharma—
Glorious guru, at your feet I pray.
With this token deed, I dedicate all the virtue of the three times,
So that I may always be guided and cared for by the gracious guru,
The source of all attainment, complete the paths and stages,
And swiftly attain the level of the three kāyas.
May this region be free from every source of difficulty,
Such as conflict, poor harvests, disease and epidemics.
Let everyone enjoy long life, good health and prosperity,
And oceans of auspiciousness fill the land in every direction.
In this dharma centre may the saṅgha always be harmonious,
Observe pure discipline and gain everything they might need.
Through their pursuit of learning and practice by day and night,
May Śākyamuni’s teachings flourish and endure long into the future.
