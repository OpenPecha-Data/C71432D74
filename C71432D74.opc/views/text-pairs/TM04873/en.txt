A Brief Practice of Paying Homage and Making Offerings to the Sixteen Elders Refuge and Bodhicitta Visualizing the Pure Realm Invocation Confession Rejoicing Imploring the Buddhas to Turn the Wheel of Dharma Requesting the Buddhas not to Enter Nirvāṇa Dedication
Oṃ svasti!
In the Buddha, the Dharma and the Supreme Assembly,
I take refuge until I attain enlightenment.
Through the merit of practising generosity and so on,
May I attain buddhahood for the benefit of beings!
May all sentient beings enjoy happiness and the causes of happiness!
May they be free from suffering and the causes of suffering!
May they never be separated from the sacred happiness devoid of suffering!
And may they dwell in boundless equanimity that is free from attachment and aversion!
By the truth of the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, the objects of refuge,
The blessings of all the victorious ones and their bodhisattva heirs,
The power of the two accumulations and the purity and strength of the dharmadhātu,
May the outer environment and its inhabitants become those of the blissful paradise of Sukhāvatī, with, in its centre,
A great celestial palace of precious gems, stunning to behold,
Inside which is a jewelled lion throne with lotus and moon-disc seats—
Here and now, may I experience this pure realm filled with clouds of actual offerings,
And those created through the power of mantras, awareness and aspiration!
namo ratna trayāya | namo | bhagavate vajrasārapramardane tathāgatāyārhate samyaksaṃbhuddhāya | tadyathā | oṃ vajre vajre mahāvajre mahātejavajre mahāyidyāvajre mahābodhicittavajre mahābodhi-maṇḍopasaṃ-kramaṇa-vajre sarvakarmāvaraṇaviśodhanavajre svāhā |
The ground is smooth like the palm of the hand, and bedecked with jewels.
It is adorned with wish-granting trees, rivers and lakes. In its centre,
In the jewelled palace with its four sides and four doors,
Upon seats of lotus, sun and moon,
Is the compassionate protector of beings, the one who sets
The beings of these troubled times on the path to liberation,
The supreme Śākyamuni together with the great sthaviras—
Come now to this place together with your retinues, we pray!
All the Victorious Ones of the ten directions and their heirs,
And those whose blazing fire of wisdom dries up the ocean of destructive emotions
And who abide by the Buddha's Words as fields of merit and liberation,
The śrāvaka saṅgha of the ten directions—all of you please come to this place!
With these offerings we invite you to stay here,
For sentient beings, let these offerings lead you to this place.
You who hold in your hands the Buddhist teachings,
Of the protector of wandering beings, Lion of the Śakyas
You who open up the treasury of excellent discourses—
Guardians of the dharma, great arhats, please stay here, we pray!
As we invite you in order to spread the sacred Dharma,
Let these offerings lead you here for the sake of beings!
You who were instructed by the Buddha to uphold the victory banner of the teachings:
Aṅgaja, Ajita and Vanavāsin,
Kālika, Vajrīputra and Śrībhadra,
Kanakavatsa and sublime Kanakabhāradvāja,
Noble Bakula and Rāhula,
Kṣudrapanthaka and Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja,
Panthaka, Nāgasena, Gopaka and Abhedya:
O arhats, great elders,
Through this invitation to this precious place of merit,
For sentient beings, let these offerings lead you to this place!
You are buddhas with perfect renunciation and wisdom,
Yet to guide beings you appear in śrāvaka form.
You whose special activity is to protect the Dharma,
Sixteen elders, come now and take your places!
You guard the teachings, especially the words of the sugatas,
And, having forsaken selfish aims, you remain in the forest of saṃsāra,
And dedicate yourselves to others—O sixteen elders,
Through the force of compassion and commitment, come now to this place!
As lay practitioners, who seek refuge and whose speech is honest,
Accept us, we pray, as servants of the Three Jewels!
As we invite you to this precious, meritorious realm,
For sentient beings, let these offerings lead you to this place!
To all the buddhas, the lions of the human race,
In all directions of the universe, through past and present and future:
To every single one of you, I bow in homage;
Devotion fills my body, speech and mind.
Through the power of this prayer, aspiring to Good Action,
All the victorious ones appear, vivid here before my mind
And I multiply my body as many times as atoms in the universe,
Each one bowing in prostration to all the buddhas.
In every atom preside as many buddhas as there are atoms,
And around them, all their bodhisattva heirs:
And so I imagine them filling
Completely the entire space of reality.
Saluting them with an endless ocean of praise,
With the sounds of an ocean of different melodies
I sing of the buddhas’ noble qualities,
And praise all those who have gone to perfect bliss.

Before you, I confess and purify each and every one.

Of buddhas and bodhisattvas,
Pratyekabuddhas, those in training and the arhats beyond training,
And every living being, throughout the entire universe.
You who are like beacons of light shining through the worlds,
Who passed through the stages of enlightenment, to attain buddhahood, freedom from all attachment,
I exhort you: all of you protectors,
Turn the unsurpassable wheel of Dharma.
Joining my palms together, I pray
To you who intend to pass into nirvāṇa,
Remain, for aeons as many as the atoms in this world,
And bring well-being and happiness to all living beings.
What little virtue I have gathered through my homage,
Through offering, confession, and rejoicing,
Through exhortation and prayer—all of it
I dedicate to the enlightenment of all beings!
Calling upon the Lord of Sages and his retinue by name, I invoke your wisdom mind!

The one true source of benefit and happiness,
May the teachings long endure!
And may the lives of the great and noble beings who uphold the teachings
Remain secure, like banners of victory!
Through the coming of the Teacher into this world,
The illuminating sunlight of his teachings,
And harmony among the community of disciplines who uphold the teachings,
May there be the auspiciousness of the teachings remaining long into the future!
