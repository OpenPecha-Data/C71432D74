Prayer to the Supreme Deities
Homage to the guru!
Great being, perfect embodiment of the infinite Three Roots,
Mahāguru Padmasambhava,
With unbearably intense and fervent longing, I pray to you:
Dispel all obstacles and grant me supreme and common siddhis!
Natural expression of the enlightened activities of the buddhas and their heirs,
Reverend lady Tārā,
To you I pray with confident and fervent longing:
May you always inspire me with your blessing!
Bestower of supreme deathlessness glowing like the moon,
Your seven eyes of wisdom bright and distinct.
Noble lady of immortality, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel—
To you I pray: grant me siddhi of longevity!
Destroyer who subjugates all māras and samaya violators,
In a form that carries out the enlightened activity of all the victorious ones,
Great and glorious Vajrakumāra, king of the wrathful—
As I constantly carry out your practice, grant me victory over the māras!
With a terrifying form possessing the nine wrathful expressions,
You annihilate all māras, obstructors and negative forces.
Pañjaranātha Mahākāla, chief of all Dharma guardians—
Never be apart from me, but care for me as your own child!
