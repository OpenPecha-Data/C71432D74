Stream to Wash Away Misdeeds and Obscurations Vajrasattva Visualization and Recitation
Above my head, on a white lotus and moon,
Sits the guru Vajrasattva.
From his body flows a stream of nectar
That purifies my misdeeds and obscurations.
oṃ vajrasattva samayam anupālaya vajrasattva-tvenopa-tiṣṭha dṛḍho me bhava sutoṣyo me bhava supoṣyo me bhava anurakto me bhava sarva-siddhiṃ me prayaccha sarva-karma śuca me cittaṃ śreyaṅ-kuru hūṃ ha ha ha ha hoḥ bhagavān sarva-tathāgata-vajra mā me muñca vajrī-bhava mahā-samaya-sattva āḥ
Vajrasattva melts into light and dissolves into me.
Through this, I too become Vajrasattva.
Light shines forth from my body and strikes other beings,
Whereby everyone is transformed into Vajrasattva.
oṃ vajra sattva hūṃ
Through the positivity and merit of this, may I swiftly
Attain the realization of Vajrasattva, and thereby
Every single sentient being
Reach his state of perfection too.
