Prayer for the Long Life of Jetsün Mingyur Paldrön 1
Illusory dance-like display arisen from wisdom's expanse,
As a nirmāṇakāya emanation to sustain those to be trained—
I pray that the one who grants the splendour of unchanging bliss,
A lamp dispelling darkness among the fortunate, may remain forever bright!
