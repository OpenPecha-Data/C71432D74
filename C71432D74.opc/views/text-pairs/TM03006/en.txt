An Instruction on the Great Perfection
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
I prostrate at the feet of the noble guru! 
Child, you who are a suitable vessel and take the Three Supreme Ones as refuge, listen! 
Your faith and intelligence are supremely stable,
You have renunciation, and are disillusioned and compassionate. 
For the likes of you, the qualities of the path
Will go on increasing like the waxing moon,
While I am busy royally devouring offerings,
And blessings and compassion only diminish. 
Still, it is certain that the reflection of blessings
Will appear in the clear, mirror-like surface
Of the minds of fortunate disciples. 
The mind is primordially pure, an empty expanse,
Complete with a spontaneously present, radiant clarity.
Looking into the very face of your own awareness,
You will be freed from the sullying defects of duality.
Meditate by settling naturally in unaltered experience.
And in spontaneous action be without hope and fear.
Whatever appears or arises will be naturally liberated, there and then.
These are instructions for the Great Perfection. 
With these words, I, the one called Chökyi Lodrö,
Wrote whatever came spontaneously to mind.
I pray that this is no different from meeting me in person!
