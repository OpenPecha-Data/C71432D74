Light Offering Prayer
May this vessel become as vast as the entire billionfold universe!
May its wick grow as large as Sumeru, the king of mountains!
May the oil within become as vast as the great ocean at the edge of the world!
And may a billion such lamps appear before each and every buddha!
Their light banishing the darkness of ignorance everywhere,
From the very peak of existence down to the lowest hell, may they reveal all the realms of buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions!
oṃ vajrāloke āḥ hūṃ
Emaho! This wondrous and amazing light, burning brightly,
I offer to the thousand buddhas of this fortunate age,
Gurus, yidam deities, ḍākinīs and dharmapālas,
And the deities of all the maṇḍalas,
In all the infinite realms of the ten directions.
May all beings, with my own parents foremost among them,
In this and in all lives to come, whatever our place of birth,
Always see directly the perfect buddhas’ realms,
And remain forever inseparable from Amitābha, ‘Lord of Boundless Light’—
Grant your blessings so that, through the power of the truth
Of the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, and the deities of the Three Roots,
This prayer of aspiration may swiftly be fulfilled!
