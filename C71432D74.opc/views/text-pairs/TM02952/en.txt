The Daily Practice of the Secret Sādhana of Dorje Drolö Taking Refuge and Arousing Bodhicitta The Visualization The Dissolution Dedication of Merit and Prayer of Auspiciousness
Namo!
In the guru, the powerful and wrathful heruka,
I take refuge. For the sake of all beings, I arouse bodhicitta.
Hūṃ! Instantaneously I visualize myself as Dorje Drolö:
Reddish-brown, ferociously wrathful and chewing his lower lip;
His right hand wields a vajra, his left a kīla of iron;
Clad in a brocade gown, Dharma robes and boots;
His hair curls to the right, and his conch earrings rattle.
Adorned with a garland of freshly severed human heads,
Amidst a blaze of wisdom fire,
He is poised on a tigress who has just given birth.
In his heart, on a sun disc, around a red hūṃ
Revolves the root mantra.
hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru drowolö loka sarva siddhi hūṃ hūṃ
With hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ , everything dissolves into clear light.
With phaṭ phaṭ phaṭ , once again assume the form of the deity.
Through this merit, may I and all beings
Mature into the form of Dorjé Drolö, subjugator of māras,
And be utterly victorious in battle over the four māras,
So that all is auspicious for us to empty the depths of saṃsāra.
