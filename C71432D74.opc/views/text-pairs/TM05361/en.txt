Daily Practice of Vajrakīla Taking Refuge and Generating Bodhicitta Main Visualization
In the guru, the glorious heruka, embodiment of all peaceful and wrathful deities,
I devotedly take refuge, and I generate the mind of awakening.
Hūṃ! Out of the indestructible basic space of suchness,
Through anger toward the enemies of compassion,
The great weapon of emotional wrath
Arises as the mark of the blue syllable hūṃ.
In an instant it is transformed,
And, standing upon lotus, sun-disc and male and female mahādevas,
My own rigpa is Vajrakumāra—the youthful Vajrakīla—
Dark blue with three faces and six arms,
The two on the right holding nine- and five-pronged vajras,
The two on the left, a mass of flames and a khaṭvāṅga,
And the last two wielding the kīla and embracing the consort.
His huge body and mighty limbs
Are arrayed in the heruka and cemetery ornaments,
As he presides amidst the blazing brilliance of wisdom fire.
At his three centres are the three seed syllables.
Samayasattva and jñānasattva clearly merge inseparably into one.
In the centre of his heart is Vajrasattva,
In whose heart, in a locket of sun and moon,
Is the blue syllable hūṃ surrounded by the mantra garland,
From which rays of light radiate in all directions, making offerings to the exalted ones and purifying all obscurations,
So that the environment and its inhabitants arise as the three maṇḍalas.
oṃ vajra kīli kīlaya sarva vighnān baṃ hūṃ phaṭ | jaḥ hūṃ āḥ
Perception of the deity dissolves into the basic space of luminosity.
Then again, I arise in the deity’s genuine form.
oṃ āḥ hūṃ
