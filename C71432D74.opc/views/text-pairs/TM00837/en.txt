Praise of White Amitāyus
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Amitāyus, Boundless Life and Wisdom,
Your name alone dispels the demon of death.
Victorious ones, as numerous as sands in the Ganges,
Scatter flowers of praise for you each and every day. 
The blessed Lion of the Śākyas,
By proclaiming the profound dhāraṇī mantra,
The song of your name and the syllable oṃ,
Bestowed the certainty of words of truth. 
All who are tormented, caught in the noose
Of the lord of timely and untimely death,
If they simply recall your name, instantly,
O victor, you will banish their mortal terrors. 
Your form is like a concentration of many billions of moons,
Your speech possesses the melody of Brahmā with its sixty tones,
And your mind is sky-like, profound, peaceful and unelaborate—
Protector Amitāyus, to you I offer homage and praise. 
Through my offering praise in this way,
May I be empowered by the amṛta that flows
From the excellent ruby vase
Of the protector, the guru Amitāyus.
