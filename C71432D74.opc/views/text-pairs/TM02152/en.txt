Verses of Refuge and Bodhichitta
Motivated by the wish to free all beings,
Continually, I shall take refuge
In the Buddha, Dharma and Saá¹…gha,
Till the essence of enlightenment is reached.
With wisdom and with heartfelt love,
Diligently, for the sake of sentient beings,
I shall place myself before the buddhas,
And generate the perfect mind of bodhicitta.
