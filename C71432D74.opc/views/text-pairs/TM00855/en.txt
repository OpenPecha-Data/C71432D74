The Sweet Sound of Perfect Joy In Praise of the Goddess Sarasvatī
Hrīṃ! Daughter of the mind of Brahmā
Arisen from the great lake of enjoyment,
With your face as pure and white as the moon—
Goddess Sarasvatī, to you I pay homage!
Unending treasury of the secret words of the Vedas,
And the vast collection of the buddhas’ Dharma,
Reaching to the end of the path of deathlessness—
Glorious Lady of Melodies, to you I bow in devotion!
Clasping a ‘tambura’ lute in your hands,
And gently playing it with the tips of your fingers.
To you who captivate the minds of all, both beyond
And still within this worldly realm, I bow!
In reality you are the Perfection of Wisdom herself,
Yet you appear in the form of a goddess,
A wondrous and inconceivable manifestation,
Great Lady who has mastered the ten bhūmis, to you I bow!
To all the buddhas who regard you with their love,
And glance at you with their eyes of wisdom,
You offer great cloud-like gifts of blissful union,
To you, the great mother of joy, respectfully I bow!
As you enter the throats and hearts of the intelligent,
In that very instant, they become transformed,
And are made powerful masters of speech—
To you, bestower of supreme intelligence, I offer praise!
Through the blessings of praising you in this way,
May you enter the milky lake of my devoted mind,
And grant me the brilliant light of wisdom,
Complete with the twofold knowledge, I pray!
Oṃ picu picu prajñā vardhani jvala jvala medhivardhani dhiri dhiri buddhi vardhani svāhā
