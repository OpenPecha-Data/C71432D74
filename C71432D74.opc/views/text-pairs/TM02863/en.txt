Praise of Sarasvatī, Goddess of Eloquence
Oṃ. May happiness and fortune prevail!
Enchanting lady, you resemble white clouds
Bedecked with lightning that beautify the sky.
You who dance amidst youthful gandharvīs,
Goddess of enduring love, come here now!
Your eyes glance about like bees on the lotus of your face
And light shines from the dark blue tresses of your hair.
Sarasvatī, you who move with elegant, seductive poise,
Bestow, right now, the siddhi of eloquence upon me!
Doe-eyed and playfully seductive in your demeanour,
A captivating vision, which one never tires of beholding,
With your deep maternal love, empower my speech
And make it just like yours, O goddess of eloquence.
Far lovelier than the splendour of a full autumnal moon,
You have a voice surpassing Brahmā’s sweetest melody
And a mind as hard to fathom as the deep, expansive sea—
Sarasvatī, I bow to your divine body, speech and mind.
