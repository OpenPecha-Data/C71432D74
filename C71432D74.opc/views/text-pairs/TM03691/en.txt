The Sweet Resonance of Thunder: A Long-Life Prayer
Oṃ svasti.
Single embodiment of the knowledge, love and wisdom
Of the victors and their heirs throughout space and time,
Glorious guru, spiritual friend,
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessings.
The nirmāṇakāya emanation of your supreme primordial wisdom,
Who causes the lotus garden of limitless teachings and beings to thrive,
Sun among teachers, Chökyi Lodrö,
I pray that your lotus feet may remain secure for an ocean of aeons.
From now until we reach the essence of awakening, may we
Offer the chakras of great bliss at our crowns before your feet.
And through the joyous celebration of your nectarous speech,
May we blessed to accomplish our own and others’ purpose.
