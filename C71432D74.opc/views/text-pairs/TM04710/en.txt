A Daily Practice of Lama Sangdü Taking Refuge Arousing Bodhicitta Visualization Mantra Recitation
Namo! Guru, in your perfect form, you embody all the sugatas;
Your nature is that of Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha.
Until I and all beings of the six realms attain enlightenment,
I take refuge in you!
To benefit all beings, I arouse the awakened mind of bodhicitta,
And once I have accomplished the enlightened state of the Guru,
By teaching each and every one according to their needs,
I shall liberate beings: this is my vow!
Out of the state of emptiness and luminosity, perfect the very instant I think of it,
The whole environment is the blazing palace of great bliss. In its centre,
I visualize myself clearly as Hayagrīva, in union with Vajravārahī,
Above the crown of my head sits Tötreng Tsal, in union with his consort.
As his own natural display, he sends out clouds of emanations—of his five enlightened forms and eight manifestations;
In the four directions preside the ḍākas of the four families with their consorts,
And all around, gather throngs of ḍākinīs and dharmapālas.
Visualize samayasattva and jñānasattva as primordially, and inseparably, one.
During the approach phase, I visualize the Guru at the crown of my head.
And recite this mantra as a prayer:
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
During the accomplishment phase, I visualize the Guru in my heart.
And recite this mantra as an offering and praise:
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma tötreng tsal vajra samaya ja siddhi pāla hūṃ
During the activity phase, I visualize myself in the form of the Guru.
And recite this mantra as a means of spontaneously accomplishing enlightened activity:
oṃ āḥ hūṃ vajra guru padma tötreng tsal vajra samaya ja siddhi pāla hūṃ
