Guru Yoga That Liberates the Illusory Body as a Kāya of Light Prayer
The whole site and environment where I am
Is transformed to appear just like Sukhāvatī,
Adorned with an array of perfect qualities—
A beautiful and enchanting pure realm.
My body melts into light and becomes emptiness.
Out of that emptiness, upon a white lotus and moon,
I manifest as Avalokiteśvara, white in colour,
With one face and two hands, the right hand in the gesture of supreme generosity,
And the left holding the stem of a white lotus flower.
He is handsomely decorated with the silk and jewel ornaments
And resembles a reflection, apparent yet empty.
At his heart centre, your own heart becomes a hollow sphere of light,
In the centre of which, within a shining pavilion of rainbow light,
Upon a multi-coloured lotus and discs of sun and moon,
Dwells one’s own root guru in the form of Amitābha,
Red in colour, and radiating light-rays.
These boundless beams of light
Pervade everywhere, inside and outside the body.
They purify the body’s flesh and bones and all its apparent solidity,
And transform it into a deathless rainbow body, a vajra-kāya.
To the Guru Amitābha, upon lotus, sun and moon
In the centre of my heart, I pray:
Purify flesh, bones and all the body’s apparent solidity,
And inspire me to accomplish the rainbow body, the kāya of light.
My own body melts into light and dissolves into Amitābha.
Lord Amitābha then fades like a rainbow in the sky.
Once again, out of the state of emptiness, in a single instant,
My own form clearly appears together with Amitābha.
