Brief Sukhāvatī Aspiration
Emaho! Wondrous Buddha Amitābha, Boundless Light,
Lord of Great Compassion Avalokiteśvara on your right,
Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta on your left, 1
And buddhas and bodhisattvas, countless, all around—
Wonderment, happiness and joy are without end
In your pure realm, ‘The Blissful’, Sukhavati.
The instant that I pass from this life,
Without any other birth in between,
May I be born there, Amitābha, and look upon your face!
Now let buddhas and bodhisattvas in all ten directions
Grant their blessing so this aspiration, this prayer of mine,
Is fulfilled, with nothing standing in the way.
