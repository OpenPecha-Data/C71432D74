Invocation for the Flourishing of the Sakya Teachings 1
Root and lineage gurus, hosts of yidam deities,
And especially Kurukullā, lady of magnetizing,
Gaṇapati and Ṭakkirāja, 2
Swift-acting White Mahākāla, the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel and the rest,
Magnetizing and enriching deities, I invoke your wisdom minds,
So that the Buddhist teachings in general and precious Sakya teachings in particular
May spread throughout the ten directions,
As we establish great centres of teaching and practice,
Attract Dharma-observing kings and ministers, wealthy householders and the like.
Let our resources be not scarce but abundant,
Accumulating as naturally as southern clouds.
And let the activities of renunciation and study thrive.
Grant your blessings so that the machinations of obstacle-making spirits
And asura-like barbarians may be thoroughly pacified,
The status of the Three Jewels rise ever higher,
And happiness and well-being increase among the teachings and beings.
