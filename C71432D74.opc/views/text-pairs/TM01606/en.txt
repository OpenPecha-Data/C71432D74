Five-Verse Doha of Yogic Realization
by Mipham Rinpoche
Namo mañjuśriye! 
Having imbibed the nectar of the guru’s advice,
And followed the lineage’s way of profound instructions,
I have arrived at the genuine state of realization,
The sovereign mind-as-such, uncontrived and naturally at rest. 
Mind is equal to space, clear and unsullied,
Naturally free from the turbulence of thought,
Innate dharmakāya, co-emergent great bliss—
Actual suchness wherein all things are equal. 
This space has never known happiness or suffering.
And awareness, too, has always been free of arising,
Without the marks of joy or sorrow, transition or change.
This is the supreme yoga—seeing the clear light of one’s own awareness. 
Within the experience of space all phenomena are vividly apparent.
Within the experience of awareness saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear as illusory.
Whatever manifests is freed by itself without gain or loss, adoption or rejection.
Multiplicity is of a single nature within this blissful yoga of space. 
May great compassion, which is truly without the slightest notion
Of reference or focus, extend to the farthest limits of space and time.
And through effortless, spontaneous enlightened activity
May I liberate the entire ocean of infinite living beings! 
Dhīḥ wrote down whatever arose spontaneously on the thirteenth day of the seventh month of the Earth Bird year of the fifteenth calendrical cycle (1909). May virtue abound!
