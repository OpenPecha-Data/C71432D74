Emptying the Three Realms of Existence
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö 
Ahoye!
The natural state of primordial purity is unimaginable and inexpressible,
Utterly beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence.
It is not a blank vacuity but by nature lucid,
Bright with the natural radiance of clear light.
Through the practice of the four lamps,
The intensely radiant visions of spontaneous perfection,
May ordinary conditioned appearances dissolve into inner space,
And in a state of unobscured primordial wisdom
Let us seize the stronghold of immovable realization
And empty the three realms of existence from their very depths!
