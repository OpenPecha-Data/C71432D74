The Sweet Song of Immortality: A Long-Life Prayer
Oṃ svasti.
Treasury of knowledge embodying the wisdom of all the victors, 1
Indivisible from great and loving Avalokiteśvara,
And from the mighty lord, the bearer of secrets, 2
Glorious guru, to you I pray. 3
Through the blessings of the guru, Mañjughoṣa in reality,
May the one whose activity tames beings of this degenerate age,
The supreme source of an ocean of intelligent study and reflection,
Live long as a guardian of the teachings in exposition and practice. 4
May the youthfulness that is the accomplishment of immortal life flourish,
The sound of Dharma wholly pervade the three planes of existence,
And the brilliant light of the sun and moon—wisdom of knowledge and love—
Blaze in splendour, bringing auspiciousness and excellence to the world.
