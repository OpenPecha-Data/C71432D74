Prayer to Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Oṃ svasti.
A great treasury of the knowing wisdom of all the victorious ones
Was the Mañjughoṣa guru with the power of knowledge and love. 1
And you are the nirmāṇakāya emanation of his enlightened activity—
Lodrö Gyatso, at your feet I pray.
May the three secrets of this supreme protector long remain secure,
May he guide and care for me in all my births and lives to come
And sustain me with nectar-like teachings on the supreme vehicle,
And may his blessings and primordial wisdom infuse my heart.
