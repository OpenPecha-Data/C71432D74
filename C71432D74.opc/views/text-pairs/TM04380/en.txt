Prayer from the Lama Yangtik
O lama, precious and enlightened one,
We have no one else to rely on but you.
Look upon us with eyes of compassion
And free us from this ocean of saṃsāra.
Help us to accomplish all that is good in life,
And avoid all that would hinder and obstruct us,
Point out profound luminosity at the moment of death,
And liberate us from the perils of the bardo states.
Ensure that all that we do with body, speech and mind
Always brings about benefit for others.
And from this day forward, transform all adversity
Into the supreme path of enlightenment.
In spite of our exertions, liberation is hard to find.
O protector, on the ship of your compassion
Carry us along with all who lack protection,
And lead us to the island of liberation.
May all those who have faith in me
And all who slander and abuse me
Be freed from evil and without afflictions,
And may they leave the rivers of existence.
In time, may my very name be enough
To fulfil the wishes of the world,
And bring down rains of offering clouds
In all the buddha realms of the ten directions.
Through this virtue, may all beings
Be liberated from saṃsāric existence
And, gaining the two sacred forms of wisdom,
Spontaneously benefit both themselves and others.
