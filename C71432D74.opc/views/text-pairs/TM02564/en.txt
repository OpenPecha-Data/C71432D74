A Daily 'Hand-Clapping' Practice of Siṃhamukhā
In an instant I appear as the ḍākinī
With the face of a lion, visualized clearly;
The mantra in my heart emanating and reabsorbing rays of light
In order to eliminate entirely all causes of harm!
a ka sa ma ra ca śa da ra sa māraya phaṭ
Namo! Root and lineage gurus, yidam deities,
And the ḍākinī, the wrathful mother subduing the māras:
Through the blessings of your great truth,
Turn back all curses, spells and evil sorcery,
All forms of adversity, tragedy and threats of danger!
Turn them back upon the hostile enemies: bhyo! 1
Turn them back upon the obstacle-makers who harm us: bhyo!
Turn them back upon negative influences, enemies and sorcerers: bhyo!
May they be averted completely, without leaving any trace behind!
By the power of the wrathful mother’s vidyā mantra,
May the māras that obstruct the attainment of enlightenment
And all causes of harm be annihilated,
And may all our wishes be fulfilled, just as we desire!
