The Perfect Equality of the Dharmadhātu
by Mipham Rinpoche
Namo Mañjuśrīye!
A key point to understand in both sūtra and mantra vehicles
Is the perfect equality of the dharmadhātu.
And when realising this perfect equality,
Realisation of the view of entities is crucial. 
Through familiarity with the key points of
The view of the Middle Way beyond concepts
And co-emergent great bliss on the path of mantra,
You'll come to understand non-conceptual simplicity,
And self-arising wisdom beyond the mind will dawn. 
When your familiarity with this becomes stable,
All the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are perfectly equal.
And the dharmakāya, the single all-encompassing sphere,
Dawns unobstructedly in your being. 
All phenomena are perfectly equal.
And in perfect equality there's no acceptance or rejection.
When you are confident about perfect equality,
Realisation is said to 'reach its limit'. 
When reaching the limit of realisation,
Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,
Pleasure and pain, self and other,
Are all liberated in perfect equality.
This is fearlesness, universal victory. 
One who has gained such universal victory,
Passes through the stages of
Vidyādhara, vīra and buddhas' heir,
And comes to train living beings,
Their every connection being meaningful. 
Thus, having realised the authentic view,
Through the instructions of the lineage,
And gained stability with supreme familiarity,
One will finally become a victorious vidyādhara. 
When this advice has matured
In the minds of those of excellent fortune,
And they see the genuine path, may they
Seize the stronghold of the vidyādhara's realisation.
I, Mipham, quickly wrote this down at Shedzong Tashi Chöling, on the 26th day of the twelfth month of the Iron Mouse year.[1]
