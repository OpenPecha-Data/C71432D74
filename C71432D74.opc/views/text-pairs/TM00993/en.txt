Spontaneously Written Song of Experience
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Aho!
The Great Perfection of primordial freedom,
Which all sentient beings possess,
Does not need to be sought elsewhere.
The original state of things, primordial purity,
The way in which the natural condition abides—
To recognise this alone is sufficient.
Mentally created contrivance is pointless.
Untainted by the phenomena of intellectual speculation,
Clinging to notions of alertness, relaxation and the like,
No matter whether the mind is active or at rest,
It is none other than rigpa's creative expression.
Saṃsāra does not make it worse;
Nirvāṇa does not make it better. 
Within the vast, all-pervasive realm of reality (dharmadhātu),
In the expanse of the single, all-encompassing sphere,
All thoughts involving the duality of perceiver and perceived
Are equal, without any basis for distinction or exclusion. 
When this is realized through the guru's kindness,
There and then, in that very moment,
There is freedom. 
This is the special feature of Ati Dzogpachenpo,
The secret pith instruction on clear light.
There is no swifter, profounder path than this
In any of the sūtras or tantras.
To encounter it puts the mind at ease. 
So that the child may follow the father's lead,
Omniscient guru, grant your blessings! 
This was written spontaneously.
