Daily Practice of Gyaltsen Tsemö Pung Gyen Refuge and Bodhicitta Self-Generation Stage Mantra Dedication Verses of Auspiciousness
Namo! In the Guru, the Three Jewels and the Yidam Deity, with devotion I take refuge.
So that I and all sentient beings as infinite as the sky
May reach supreme unsurpassed Buddhahood,
I shall practice the vidyā-queen Gyaltsen Tsemo.
Dhvaṃ! On a lotus and a moon, my own mind as a gold-colored syllable dhvaṃ
Becomes the goddess Gyaltsen Tsemo with a golden body.
I have four faces: the middle gold, right white, left red, and middle upper one the color of smoke.
In each of my faces there are three wrathful eyes. My belly hangs down.
My two right hands hold a sword and a wheel,
And the left hands hold a lasso and vajra pestle.
My hair flows upward with dry skulls as a crown ornament; I stand with the left leg stretched out.
I am adorned with beautiful silks and precious jewels of various kinds.
At my heart, on the moon is the syllable dhvaṃ surrounded by the mantra.
From there, lights radiate, making offering and invoking the buddhas.
All the fears and obstacles that plague sentient beings are removed.
And the power of adversaries is eradicated.
Through the lights gathering back and dissolving into me,
My power and strength are fully developed.
oṃ dhvajāgrakeyūra hūṃ hūṃ hūṃ phaṭ phaṭ svāhā
Finally, through reciting "Hūṃ! Hūṃ! Hūṃ!" I, appearing as the deity, dissolve into emptiness.
Through reciting "Phaṭ! Phaṭ! Phaṭ!" I again appear as the deity.
And then through reciting "Oṃ āḥ hūṃ", the white oṃ , red āḥ and blue hūṃ protect my three places.
Through this merit, may I quickly
Accomplish the goddess Gyaltsen Tsemo.
And may all sentient beings without exception
Be established in her state.
May the days be well, may the nights be well.
May the hours of noon bring happiness too.
May the day and night always be well.
May we have the auspiciousness of the Three Jewels.
