Song Composed for Drokyab Lishu Tupten Sangye Özer[1]
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö
Aho!
In the dharmakāya expanse, unborn and pure from the beginning,
Natural clarity, unceasing and spontaneous, is the sambhogakāya,
And nirmāṇakāya’s natural power tames with ceaseless compassion—
Guru Padmākara in whom the three kāyas are inseparable, care for me! 
May I break through the confines of my dualistic perception and delusion,
Directly realise the undeluded natural state of self-arising pure awareness,
Which is free from the ordinary conceptual mind and its speculations,
And seize the stronghold of my primordial nature within this very lifetime. 
May the pure altruistic wish to lead all sentient beings of the six classes
And three realms, my very own mothers, to the lasting bliss of liberation
And the supreme mind of awakening arise effortlessly within my being,
And may I receive the siddhi of emptying saṃsāra from its very depths! 
Composed by Chökyi Lodrö at the request of Drokyab Lishu Tubten Sangye Özer.
