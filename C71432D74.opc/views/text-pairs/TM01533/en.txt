General Offering to the Male Protectors 1
Hūṃ. Lhachen Palbar, Gönpo Lekden, Gaṇapati,
Pañjaranātha, Four-Faced Mahākāla, Bernakchen, and Mahākālas with Four and Six Hands—
All you hosts of protector deities of the male class,
I supplicate you and make offerings to you: grind enemies and obstructors to dust!
