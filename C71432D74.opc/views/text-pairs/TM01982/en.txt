A Devotional Song 1
Emaho! Upon the scintillating pistils of an eight-petaled lotus
In full bloom at the center of my faithful heart,
You sit, Great Tertön, guru of threefold kindness, in a sphere of five-colored light.
I pray to you with fervent, piercing devotion!
Throw open the glorious door of your wondrous wisdom and love,
And bless my three doors as deity, mantra, and dharmakāya!
The consummate, utmost profundity of the Lord of Uḍḍiyāna’s wisdom mind
Is the four fierce Acala classes who overpower the four demons.
Blue Acala is the slayer of the demon of distraction, the son of the gods.
Upon us teachers and disciples, trained in the two stages of Acala,
And striving in the main practice, the yoga of fierce heat,
Bestow, we pray, the siddhi that rouses the wisdom of blissful warmth!
