In Praise of the Three Jewels
To the referenceless dharmak훮ya,
The k훮ya of perfect enjoyment,
And the k훮ya of diverse manifestion,
In devotion, I pay homage.
To the utterly pure dharmadh훮tu,
The eighfold noble path of practice,
And the excellent speech of the teachings,
In devotion, I pay homage.
To the bodhisattvas,
The arhats and so on,
And the pratyekabuddhas,
In devotion, I pay homage.
