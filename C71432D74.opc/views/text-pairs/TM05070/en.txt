A Prayer to Noble White Tārā
Brilliant white, with the vibrant vigor of a thousand moons,
In your supreme form of major and minor marks, you are the destroyer of Māra, Lord of Death,
And bestower of the supreme siddhis of longevity and wisdom—
Noble Tārā, Wish-Fulfilling Wheel, to you I pray!
oṃ tāre tuttāre ture svāhā
